Maintaining a Ph of 7.0 was difficult but possible, but my snails had the white pitting and my guppy had fin rot that he contracted during the time when I was totally new to fish keeping and didn't understand how important it is to snails and guppies to keep the Ph at or above 7.0.\n\nI had finally got the situation under control. My guppy's fins were regenerating and my snails had new shell growth that was healthy.\n\nThen I made the grave mistake of trying this product. Aloe vera? So what. Looked like a stupid gimmick. Since when do fish need aloe vera? Do we need to pull them out of the tank and rub moisturizing cream on them too? How about some Lubriderm?\n\nAnyway, shortly after switching to this product my Ph crashed to 6.0. My guppy's fins started rotting and got worse than ever, and the healthy growth on my snails that survived me climbing the learning curve last Summer now have white calcified shell damage. I don't even recognize the two I named just a few months ago!\n\nI was doing emergency water changes morning and evening just to keep the Ph at about 6.4. (My tap water is totally soft, but comes out of the tap at PH of about 7.2). My hands got raw and cracked because I was washing my hands so much after working with the tank so much.\n\nI asked myself what had changed when this started, and the only thing I came up with was switching to this aloe vera stress coat. Then I looked up aloe vera juice on the Internet and found it has a Ph of 3.5 to 5.0 depending on where I looked. Wow, I thought, maybe putting something with Ph that low in the tank could throw the whole Ph down quite a bit.\n\nI bought some Tetra brand stress coat and did a few more water changes (some cracks in hands bleeding now, maybe MY hands could use some aloe vera!!) and soon the Ph climbed back up to 6.8.\n\nI did two emergency salt dips for the guppy, whose fin rot had begun on his body too. It looks like the rot has been halted. The damage has been done to my snails. Maybe once I get this under control I'll have time to just stare at the tank a while and figure out who is who again through all the shell damage.\n\nSo, thanks API for putting my fish and snails through hell.

They do not eat plants, and they shouldn't eat dried pellets, flakes or freeze-dried food, which bind them up.\n- They need heated water (75-80).\n- They need a clean tank just like every other fish.\n- A single betta with the correct supplies for living by itself will cost about $100.

My dog is already doggie door trained. She's a pretty intelligent client. However, even an intelligent dog and an adult human (that has read over and over the instruction manual) can have a hard time figuring out the automatic setting on this door. And I finally figured out why we were having such difficultly- the door only works when it wants to. The sensor isn't nearly powerful enough (on any range setting). My dog is pretty low to the ground and the key only seems to work when I point it directly at the door. Needless to say, I haven't quite trained my dog to turn and position the key just right in relation to the door- lacking thumbs and all, it would be kind of difficult for her.\n\nAlso when it does register, the door only stays unlocked for a few seconds before it locks again and resets. So if you're dog doesn't make it out of the door in time, they have to stand there for 10 seconds until the door registers the key again. I've tried to explain this to my dog, but I don't think she gets it. She just scratches on the door and when it doesn't open, pisses on the carpet.\n\nIf your dog does manage to point the key at the right angle and moves fast enough to get out of the door before it closes- the door can still get stuck in the open position. If the door is open when it attempts to lock it just freezes where ever it happens to be. Letting my cats out and defeating the purpose of having an automatic dog door in the first place. If I didn't care what animals got in or out of my house I would have bought a cheap flappy door or cut a random hole in the wall for free.\n\nIn my opinion, PetSafe has to step it up before anyone else bothers to install this door. Just house train your dog, pay a pet sitter, take your dog to work with you, or just don`t get a dog at all. All of these options are better than buying this door.\n\nPetSafe: Just because your's is the only product on the market doesn't give you the right to suck.", "summary": "The rating of this door gets lower and lower everyday", "unixReviewTime": 1223596800}

I wanted to insist that I read it myself and didn't. I am usually very thorough about such things. My bad! My dog eats a lot of fruit and vegetables along with her excellent diet of Primal and Orijen and Arcana dog food (all of which have vegetable and fruit content - but no grains)  so I figured plant fiber shouldn't be a problem.\n\nA few hours after I gave her the chew she started having loose stools.\nThen all night long she kept waking me up to go outside.\nI get up this morning and she has leaked all over the carpet in multiple places (she looked so sad about that, poor thing) Because its so watery and the treats are dark green, it has stained my carpet permanently and I have professional strength stain remover)\n24 hours later she is still going (liquid), and the skin around her bottom and under her tail is red and sore.\nI called the vet and reported it and got the name of the brand and looked up the ingredients.\n\nIngredients\nCorn Starch, Glycerin, Soy Bean Protein, Rice Flour, Palatable Agent (Sacharomyces cerevisiae), Sorbitol, Corn Cob, Water, Potassium Sorbate. Made in Vietnam.\nI was not surprised but was disappointed to see this list.\n\nNOTE THAT THERE ARE NO VEGETABLES IN THIS CHEW! Dried corn is a grain, not a vegetable.\nOn the CET site \"Veggie-based chews ideal for daily use in a home dental care regimen\nClean your dog's teeth and freshen his breath - in one easy step! VeggieDent is a delicious, veggie-based chew...\"\nThe manufacturers claim that these are veggie based chews are misleading. These are GRAIN CHEWS!\nAlso, why are they dark green? There is no green plant matter in them!\n\nNow, the ingredients: (please note that I did a quick search on each ingredient. Many other references other than the ones provided are available. You may wish to cross check this information with other sources. I am not a vet. Just a concerned puppy mother)\n\nCorn and corn cobs:\nCorn is not good for any dog as it is very high on the glycaemic index. the more finely the corn is ground, the more if affects blood sugar. It is also highly indigestable and many dogs have allergic reactions and digestion problems with it.  Corn is added to so many dog foods because it is a cheap filler as it is an industrial biproduct from the human food industry which equals more $$$ for dog food manufacturers.\n\nSoy Bean Protein:\n\"Soy has been linked to gas and deadly bloat in dogs. It is high in purines and is therefore a completely inappropriate protein source for urate-forming dogs. It is also high in silicates and promotes the formation of silica stones. The carbohydrate action of soy can cause a rise in blood sugar in many cats. Soy is also linked to thyroid damage.....The ingestion of soybean products is also linked to seizures in both dogs and cats.\nI hope I've given you a more complete understanding of why avoiding pet foods containing soy products is best for your favorite four-legged companion. In my opinion, the potential risks associated with feeding soy are simply unacceptable  especially when you consider your carnivorous cat or dog prefers and receives a much higher level of nutrition from animal protein sources. \"  Dr Karen Becker. Mercola.\n\nSorbitol:\n\"Sugar or sweetener is an absolutely unnecessary ingredient in pet foods, added to make the product more attractive. Continuous intake can promote hypoglycemia, obesity, nervousness, cataracts, tooth decay, arthritis and allergies. Pets also get addicted to foods that contain sugars, so it can be a tough piece of work to make them eat something healthier.\" The Dog Food Project\n\nRice Flour:\nAlso a very high glycaemic food.\n\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\nThis is a yeast. The media upon which it was grown has not been identified but according to the Dog Food Project and many other sources it is a potential allergen dor some dogs.\n\nPotassium Sorbate:\n\"Potassium sorbate is considered safe for both dogs and cats at a maximum content of 5 000 mg/kg semi-moist complete feed, based on the limited data available in the public literature. Potassium sorbate is a skin and eye irritant and a potential irritant of the respiratory tract.\" European Food Safety Authority\n\nThe manufacturer of these chews is cutting corners and profit is thier first priority. They are not in the business of manufacturing healthy chews. I see that there are many positive reviews here for them. And if your dog didn't react then that is great. My dog loved the taste!

The distributor then told me that if it was damaged in shipment, we should have refused it from UPS.  Considering I was not there, that was a little hard to do.

Since her throwing up hairballs constantly isn't getting any better I will be transitioning her to new food.\n\nI realize a few others have noted the same problem with the new formula. Hopefully if enough of us voice our complaint  Hill's will change the formula back or at least resolve the issue with the new formula causing cats to throw up hairballs on a weekly basis (which is exactly what the hairball control cat food is suppose to prevent).\n\nUPDATE 12/3/13:\nSince the original review I transitioned my cat to Royal Canin Intense Hairball 34 Formula. She has been on Royal Canin solely for about 6 weeks now. After switching to Royal Canin my cat has completely stopped coughing up hairballs.

That said, when this was slowly introduced, bit by more bit, to my very sensitive and selective GSD, he liked it. But it took him the longest-ever time for his system to adjust. He had diarrhea throughout and when he finally figured out towards the bag's finish (yes, we took this very slowly), that it was this ZiwiPeak food making his tummy hurt and spew painful bathroom time, he began to avoid eating it. Quite a few reviewers mention that this was also for the sensitive and finicky, but sadly for my poor guy, it wasn't so.\n\nThis food is very dry and handles well. It looks like small square-cut flattened jerky. In fact, they're so small and flat that my big dog consistently struggled to eat all the ones that were stuck to the bottom of his food bowl. Given how pricey this food is, it seemed wasteful, the amount that my dog couldn't bite or lick up. So each and every time I had to scrape up the stuck saliva-ridden, very thin jerky squares he couldn't manage to get into his mouth, which he'd then finally get to finish. It was added effort for each meal to have to do. If they could offer this in a bigger, thicker cut for bigger dogs' mouths, it could be ideal for those without sensitivity issues.\n\nThis came in a resealable bag, which was nice. This would have been perfect for traveling, if only it hadn't disrupted his bowels. Perhaps it was just a simple case of him needing more time to adjust to, for instance, the \"green-lipped mussel\" ingredient?

I do notice a fresher breath after use and, no, the breath does not smell like poultry afterwards. It just doesn't stink as bad. I am very disappointed with all my effort and to find that his teeth are decaying anyways. I've tried different toothbrushes and that didn't help. I tried using a wash rag to gently massage his teeth, that didn't work. Dental chews upset his belly and he does not like raw food or raw bones. Now, I'm thinking about trying my old Sonicare on him. I know the Sonicare will clean the heck out of his teeth, I just don't know if it will scare him due to it sounding like the grooming clippers. Another odd thing is that my dog has gotten worse and worse about letting me brush. He used to be ok with it because I think he really did enjoy the taste, but now he abhors it! Makes me sad forcing him especially when it is looking like we will have to get a professional cleaning one day in the near future. I did not want to do that and have my dog knocked out and that's why I have been so religious about the brushing. I'm pretty upset that it was all for naught.

You just need to let the heater stabilize which takes about a few hours depending on how much you want the temp to raise. I noticed that It heated up the water slowly maybe because it's made to not to shock the fishes. I raised the temp from 84 to 86 degrees. It heated my tank at a rate of about .5 degrees every 30 mins. And I have my tank in a cold room. The heater holds my tank temperature of 86 degrees constantly with a +/- .5 degrees in a avg room temp of 61 degree in a 25 gallon tank. I use a digital cooking thermometer to measure the temp and I check it every couple of hours.\nThe knob to adjust the temp is nice and big so it's easy to turn making it easy to adjust the temp in small increments.\n(I had the Aquatop heater and the knob was thin which made it very hard to turn and adjust the temp.)\nThis heater is rated for 68 -93 degrees and I had it at the 86 degrees marking so I assume it can reach 93 degrees. The Aquatop heater is rated the same but I had to set it above the 89 degree marking just to reach 86 degrees. So it probably won't be able to get the water above 90 degrees. I had the same problem with the Aqueon Pro heater which is rated 68 - 88 degrees. I had it set for 86 degrees and the temp of my tank kept dropping from 86 to 84.5 degrees so I pulled out the heater when it dropped to 84.5 degrees. It's important to have a heater that can reach temp in the 90's for Ick, for certain meds and for treating your fishes w/o meds.\nThe heater is about 15\" long from the top of the dial knob to the bottom of the heater with the glass tube about 12\" long.\nThe only negative is the degree marking on the heater tube is hard to read.\nPros - holds temp constantly\n- adjustment knob nice and big which makes it easy to turn\n- accurate degree marking (but ALWAYS use a separate thermometer to check temp)\n- can reach the temps it's rated for\n\nCons - hard to read degree marking\n\nI had the Aquatop and Aqueon Pro and returned both of them.

The light would not go on then I turned up the temp. I tested to see if the heater was working yesterday and it was. Then today I saw the temp at 72 degrees when it should have been at 80. Tried to turn up the temp but no light. Took it out of the aquarium and the tube was cold. The heater has died.\nIt worked well before it died. I rather it died than malfunction and overheat the aquarium. It only lasted from Feb to Nov., 9 months. 5 stars to 2 stars. 2 stars because it didn't malfunction and over heat the aquarium otherwise 1 star.

For example, use all organic plant products as the vegetation (potatoes, celery, spinach, apples) used in this formula are found on the Dirty Dozen list http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/list.php\n\nMy dog is eliminating massive piles of waste. We're talking two hand scoopers, and he is eliminating 5-6 times a day. I suspect it's from the large amounts of fibre in the food. Sure, fibre helps moves things along but a lot of fibre doesn't mean it's healthy. When he eats his raw food, he goes twice a day, maybe three times and his stool is much smaller. Now his BM's are like the size of a Great Dane's droppings. My dog actually had a disaster of an accident in the house. Just when I thought he was done eliminating for the day, I was wrong. I question how much of the nutrients he is actually absorbing.\n\nA few things that leave me puzzled:\n\n1) The product is Made in the U.S.A. and the company states they want to reduce their carbon footprint. However ingredients are sourced from across the globe. Why? We know the longer food travels, the less nutritious it is.\n2) It annoys me when companies say they use \"organic when possible\". That simply means they're not committed to using organic ingredients. The U.S.A. has a thriving organic farming industry. Are organic fruits and vegetables not available to the company in the U.S.A.?\n3) The use of filler ingredients like white potatoes, flaxseed.\n\nSome positive notes about the food:\n\n1) Dry formula is easier to store than raw.\n2) Good to have on hand in case of emergency.

I put the litter bin in the corner of the cage and filled it with the litter.  In 2 hours time, I noticed my guinea pig was using it and I thought, \"Wonderful! Now the cage bedding will last a few days longer!\"  However, in a couple of days, I noticed each corner of the cage was being utilized for evacuation.  I normally clean the cage 1-2 times/week as there is only 1 guinea pig (Wilson) and was really hoping the litter box would allow me 1-2 times/every two weeks, of course with normal emptying of the litter box.  That is where the problem lies.  I went in 1 day later to empty the litter bin and noticed the pellets had become quite mushy; almost clay-like.  I gave the cage a thorough clean and bathed my little piggie and found his poor little paws were caked with the wet cement remnants of the pellets.  I had to soap and and soak his little claws and manually clean them out.  No wonder he stopped using the litter bin after 1 day.  I think it works to direct the guinea pig to evacuate in that spot, however, you will have to empty and replace everyday and that can get expensive...  I decided to finish the bag of litter and have chosen not to buy it again as the regular cage filler works fine in his litter bin and he prefers it as he has been using his litter bin 70% and the corners of his cage 30%.  If you are going to try this litter, you should change it at least once a day (depending on how much your little cavvy eats) because as soon as they empty their bladder, the pellets will turn to mush and it is not fun to clean that out.

The station installed on my 36 gallon tank....caused a male dwarf gourami to decide that inside  and directly around the plastic box was his territory. Any fish that approached the platform and plastic box after food had dropped was rammed and chased by the dwarf gourami as a rule of thumb. This type of fish is occasionally territorial but generally peaceful and considered non-aggressive, so I imagine the possibility of the described scenario would be higher in tanks with aggressive or more territorial fish. The end result? One extremely bloated and fat dwarf gourami and a tank full of much thinner and more stressed fish.\n\nI was cautious of overfeeding and having water quality issues as a noob to aquariums, so the cleanliness aspect of this feeding station appealed to me in the advertising. Admittedly, the clamp design for the platform is very well designed and the plastic box slides up and off easily- so the solution to my problem was to remove the box and simply leave the eheim automatic feeder on the remaining platform. Ultimately, fish looking for flake food on the surface do not seem to easily notice food sinking and drifting in a narrow vertical column under the feeding box, which is exactly what happens, because only one to two fish can fit in the box simultaneously to eat the food before it sinks.\n\n Having observed the process for a couple of weeks, my opinion is that this feeding station with it's small plastic box will encourage a few dominant fish to gorge themselves at the expense of the rest of the community, and I am skeptical of any benefits to the product as far as cleanliness/water quality.", "summary": "Great engineering, flawed concept", "unixReviewTime": 1463184000}

Karr", "reviewText": "Here is a comparison of 5 types of bedding options I've tried for my guinea pig.\n\n1) EZWhelp puppy pads - Trying to save money with this reusable option, but unfortunately the guinea pig's fur started turning yellow because it needs more \"stuff\" to brush up against his legs and absorb pee off them. The pads were very wet to the touch and leaking a little because the guinea pig peed so much. I suppose I could have put in some towels on top to add absorption, but by this time I was tired of having to clean hay from my washer and pet hair from my clothes. The guinea pig also would step on his poop and get it on his paws, so I had to be vigilant about removing the poop. I give these a 2 for messiness and not keeping my pet clean.\n2) Aspen shavings - Cheapest bedding. Nice woody smell. Not very good absorption - I can see wetness on the bottom of the cage when I scoop it. Depending on the brand, you may need to watch out for sharp pieces of wood. I give these a 3.5 for lack of absorption but good odor control and price.\n3) CritterCare - The little pieces feels hard like cardboard. They also get compacted easily and poop stays on top, which means the guinea pig steps on poop and frequently gets it stuck in his paws. Odor control isn't the greatests. However, it absorbs pretty well. And wetness shows up clearly allowing me to spot clean easily. I give these a 3 for absorption but poop on paws.\n4) Carefresh - It is similar to CritterCare in wetness absorption and odor control. However, pieces seem softer, and it doesn't get as compacted than CritterCare although occasionally, poop still gets stuck on his paws. I don't like the blue bedding because it dyes his privates blue (not healthy). The white makes it hard to see and remove wet spots. Odor control is disappointing. I give these a 3.5 for absorption and texture but lack of odor control.\n5) Kaytee - This is basically shredded tissue paper. At first, I was so excited because it looked and felt like soft, fluffy snow. It did keep the guinea pig's fur and paws cleaner. Unfortunately, this stuff gets very messy on your carpet when it's on its way to or away from the cage. The pieces are so thin and small and tend to fall all over the place. It also tends to clump together, making it difficult to separate the soiled spots from clean bedding. The white color makes it hard to see wet spots. Moreover, odor control and absorption are both disappointing. I can see liquid on the bottom of the cage under wet bedding. I give it a 2 for messiness and lack of absorption.\n\nAfter all these tries, I decided to go back to Aspen because my husband is always complaining about odor. I'm planning to mix it with some Carefresh, as some people do, to improve absorption.", "summary": "Comparison of 5 bedding options for guinea pig", "unixReviewTime": 1492041600}

Her main way of destroying toys is to hold down one part of the toy under her front paws/legs and pull up with her teeth on another part of the toy.  So there is one thing about the design of this toy that is great -- since it stretches, and it stretches quite a bit, she can't pull bits off by her usual method.  But she still tried to do so, so it kept her entertained.\n\nAfter awhile, she started working on the elephant ears, and it wasn't too long (5 minutes, which is actually not bad for *my* dog) before she had a hole in one of them so I had to take it away.  She did not damage the body or the ball end.  She actually didn't deactivate the squeakers, either.\n\nIf I could change one thing about this toy (to increase my rating), I think I would just give it two ball ends with no ears/trunk/etc.  It is not as cute, but the appearance of dog toys is mostly to please humans -- the dogs don't care whether it is a purple elephant or a long blue tube.

You can see my video review of them here: https://www.amazon.com/review/R3FYBWTCI1SXTA/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm\n\nNow back to my original review:\n\nFirst off, my dog (85 lb German Shepherd) has pannus. The purpose of doggles is to protect his eyes from UV light so that he doesn't go blind. I could care less about the coolness factor, this review is strictly based on the ability to protect my dogs eyes from the sun, and his comfort in wearing them.\n\nSecond, I'm writing the same review for all the doggles, as a comparison, so you don't have to go looking through my other reviews to see how well the other types of doggles worked, or didn't work.\n\nThird, I only make my dog wear them when it is sunny or overcast outside. I generally try to take him for walks/runs when it is either early morning/evening, or cloudy days. But he's full of energy, so I have to take him out on sunny days. This is when he wears doggles.\n\nWith the disclaimers aside:\n\n1st choice:  Doggles Mesh Eyewear\n\nI only recently tried these, and wish I had tried them sooner. I think what kept me from buying these is that in the photos, it appears as if your dog is not able to see through these, and because it only protects from 50 to to 60% of UV light. After spending ridiculous amounts of money in search for the perfect eye protection on every kind of doggle out there, this has become my first choice, though still far from perfect.\n\nMy dog can see very well with these, tolerates these the best out of all the other doggles. Will play with these on, and even chase a ball if other dogs are around chasing the same ball. I have noticed that sometimes he can't follow the toy as well, but that seems to be based on how fast the toy is flying and how high I throw it. So I still have to change how I play with him, but at least now he will play with eye protection on, which is huge.\n\nThe mesh is very light, which is why I think he doesn't mind it. It is kind of awkward looking as the mesh has pointy ends that cause it to stick out and not be laying directly on his eyes. I had my dog wear these for a full day once, and when coming back inside, I noticed he didn't rub his eyes against the couch as much as he does with other doggles.\n\nThe only reason I can't give this five stars is because it is only 50 to 60% uv protection rather than a 100% as offered with other doggles. This is a concern for me as the UV rays can really damage my dogs eyes due to the pannus. However, since my dog doesn't try to take these off anywhere near as much as the other doggles, I feel he gets a lot more protection from these since he actually keeps them on.\n\nSince trying these, I have bumped down the ranking on the other doggles as noted below.\n\n1st and 2nd choice: Doggles Large K9 Optix sunglasses, frameless\n\nThese are by no means perfect, and I fear the day they get broken. So far they have lasted several months with taking extreme good care of them. The reason they are one of my top choices is because they are 100% UV protection and my dog minds them the least (with the exception of the mesh doggles which are half the UV protection). I think what he hates about most doggles is that they have a bulky and heavy frame (from a dog's perspective), and they are not one lens, thus making them heavier on his head, and reducing his visibility. With these frameless doggles he does generally well, and is only intolerant of them when he's bored. He doesn't try to take these off as much, and as long as I have him distracted (going to a new place or chasing a critter), he doesn't mind them. He will more often than not play ball or catch a Frisbee with these on, but sometimes not. I wish I could give these five stars, but they are flimsy, and will fall apart eventually. I gave it four stars simply because they have held together thus far, with extra care. What really made this my top choice, is that they are frameless. I can see a huge difference in how my dog sees through these doggles in comparison to other doggles. So this gets first place simply for his comfort in vision. The straps fit nicely behind his ears and under his chin. If only they were made a little more sturdy...\n\nI am making these both my first and second choice because the mesh eyewear only offers half of the UV protection that these do, and I can't use the mesh eyewear on really bright sunny days due to lack of the UV protection.\n\n2nd choice: Doggles OriginalZ\n\nThe doggles originalZ only come with one color lens, which really isn't a big deal, but I have learned that even on overcast days, my dog needs eye protection, and he's less tolerant of these on overcast days versus on very sunny days. I think the darkness of the lens may reduce his visibility. He tries to paw his doggles off more so than with the frameless pair, but he minds these less than the ILS doggles. Overall, I'm happy with these because he does do fairly well with them when distracted, but I can tell he dislikes them. He usually will not chase a ball or Frisbee with these on, especially if there are other dogs around. I think he can't see the ball/Frisbee as well, and other dogs can, so he just gives up. Unless we're doing something new and exciting, he generally will find a shady spot, lay down, and watch the world play around him. It's sad to see him this way, but going blind will be worse for him, so I keep making him wear them. The doggles are well designed with the strap that goes behind his head and under his chin, which is easily adjustable, and vent holes on the sides of the doggles so that his eyes don't sweat/fog up.\n\n3rd choice: Doggles ILS\n\nI started out with the ILS doggles since they were the newest doggle out, and I liked the idea of the interchangeable lenses. I tried several colors of lenses, and found that my dog minds the brown lenses the least. It is nice to be able to remove the lenses that are scratched up and replace them with shiny new ones, and it's also nice to put in the clear lenses for overcast days when I want my dog to be able to see more, with the darkest lenses on really sunny days. So why not my favorite doggle? The dog hates them. The design is almost the same as the originalZ, with a few differences. The straps seem about the same as the originalZ, and the vent holes only differ in shape. The nose piece seems to be further apart than the originalZ, and even though the frame, when compared to the originalZ when not on, seems the same, they are a lot bulkier when on. I also found the foam that is between the doggles and the dogs eye is a little different, and seems to fall apart easier than the originalZ. The doggles company actually was kind enough to throw in some free foam with my latest order, but even super gluing it didn't seem to hold it well in place. Because the ILS doggles are much bulkier than the originalZ, and the dog hates bulky things on his face, he tries harder with these than any other doggles to get them off. Often, I find him running back to me with his doggles all distorted on his face with the straps all tangled. I have no idea how he manages, but it's sad to see him running back to me for help to fix his doggles, which I'm sure he's hoping I take off. No way would he even consider chasing a ball or catching a Frisbee with these on.\n\nLast choice: Doggles K9 Optix Blue Rubber Gradient Frame with Smoke Lens Sunglasses\n\nThese are almost frameless, top of the frame is very thin, so my dog didn't seem to mind them as much, however, they broke within a week, even with very careful use, and constant watching of my dog so that he doesn't paw at them, and taking care to put them in a safe place when not in use. These were my favorite except for the fragility of them, until I found the frameless.\n\nOkay, for those designers out there that want to make the perfect doggle, I hope you are reading this. You need a single lens doggle that is still very durable, sturdily built, and not too bulky. Basically, a single lens across both eyes, with a very light frame if any, such as the mesh with a softer plastic that is still 100% UV protection. Dogs are not human and do not see like humans, so why only create something that works for humans is beyond me. The frames in between the eyes are bothersome to the dog, and the bulk of most doggles (especially the ILS) causes discomfort. I actually bought a pair of ski goggles for humans and ended up sewing a chin strap to it to see if that would work, but it was too bulky and he was able to get them shook off by just shaking his head. But I could tell that his eyesight was just fine with the single lens.\n\nLastly, when back inside and we remove the doggles, my dog immediately runs to the couch and rubs his eyes against it, which we talked to the dog eye specialist about. It was suggested, that after wearing doggles, rather than let the dog rub his eyes against objects, that we put icepacks on his eye area. Just a little hint for those who have the same problem.", "summary": "I've tried every doggle out there, and I'm still looking for something that works", "unixReviewTime": 1392595200}

Somewhat. It will not completely kill fleas on contact, although they clearly do not like it. If they are in contact with it long enough, they will die, but if they hop away immediately they'll survive with no problem. However, neither my nor my roommate's dog was comfortable with the smell. Their nose started running and they were sneezing, they were fine once we washed the spray off.\n\nWe also had better luck getting this flea spray to work when we used a flea comb at the same time. It'll make the spray sud/bubble up, so as you brush the fleas get caught in the bubbles and can't get away. Then rinse the dog off afterward and you're done. It works out really, really well for this, but does not work as a preventative spray (when going outside in areas known to have fleas) nor as a good bedding spray, since it leaves a residue that will sud up once it gets slightly wet (such as from wet feet after coming out of the shower)\n\nOur dogs started hiding as soon as they see us with this spray bottle, we've diluted it with some extra water and the dogs are much more tolerant of it now. They still don't appear to like it very much though, the smell is far too strong for dog noses.\n\nTo summarize;\n\nPROS:\n- Kills fleas with direct, prolonged contact\n- Works really well when paired with a flea comb\n- Strong minty scent\n\nCONS:\n- Does not work as advertised\n- Will not kill fleas on contact (the contact must be 5+ seconds minimum, if they hop away prior to that they will survive)\n- Leaving the product in the pet's fur will make the pet sick (will not prevent the pet from chewing itself)\n- Leaving the product in the pet's fur will NOT prevent fleas from returning (once it dries fleas don't seem to notice it)\n- Spraying on carpets/bedding/etc does not work. It will make the fleas jump away initially, but they will return as soon as it dries.\n- Smell is too strong for the animals, makes them sneeze + gives them a runny nose, they clearly dislike it.\n\nConclusion:\n- It works IF you use it with a flea comb at the same time and immediately wash your pet off afterward\n- Does not smell like strong chemicals (but the scent makes pets uncomfortable without watering it down)\n- Does not work as a furniture or carpet spray\n- Only worth the money if you are willing to use it with a comb and dilute the spray. (An upside is that diluting the spray will help you stretch it further, I'd suggest buying another spray bottle to help you do that though.)", "summary": "WARNING: Do not leave in your pet's fur! + Detailed review and summary", "unixReviewTime": 1494547200}

Glass", "reviewText": "I am trying to get my cats, 5 and 11 years of age, eating more of a combo natural and/or raw diet. After reading many reviews, I decided to give this a try first to ease into it. Both my cats like beef flavored cat food and love real salmon, so I thought I would have the greatest chance of success with this beef & salmon flavor combination.\n\nThe idea is good, maybe not as expensive as pure raw,(though it is much more expensive than regular cat food bought in the grocery store) and is pretty easy to prepare since one only has to add some water. I followed the instructions for adding water - it only said to add one teaspoon per serving, but I didn't feel that was enough water. That amount of water did nothing and I wasn't able to mix the food enough. I did add a little more, but not much, and put it down for my cats.\n\nWell, they both came over to their bowls to sniff it, but that was it. They just would not even try it. I even left it there for a while figuring that if they were hungry, they would try it, but no go. Neither one of my cats wanted anything to do with this food, so this is why I gave it 3 stars. I had a feeling my younger cat, age 5, wouldn't eat it since she doesn't like much of anything. She won't even touch raw meat, not even cooked meat or chicken. She will eat canned tuna & salmon, though. My older 11 yr old cat is very picky with cat food. He tends to like beef, tuna, salmon, and sometimes turkey flavors, but is very picky with brands. He might eat tuna in one brand, but not another. He does, though, LOVE raw and cooked meats. I have given him a tiny bit of raw hamburger meat that he's eaten. I've given him cooked chicken & cooked turkey, and he gobbles it up. He just will not touch this freeze dried food.", "summary": "Good Idea, But My Cats Don't Like It", "unixReviewTime": 1373760000}

This particular cat is highly partial to beef (doesn't care for chicken or even some kinds of fish) so I bought a couple of cans of this food to try it out.\n\nFirst, the cat's assessment -- she practically inhales the food.  I feed her a half a can of this as a treat each day and it doesn't take her very long to eat, at all.  She gets excited when she sees me pick up cans off the counter.\n\nNext, the texture.  To me, this food looks like chunks of some cat food \"composite\" and doesn't really look like \"sliced\" beef.  The pieces are a little bigger than other cat foods with this texture.  This food would not be appropriate for cats with dental problems, I think, but should work if your cat's teeth are healthy.\n\nAs for ingredients, this is definitely NOT a natural or premium food (which is why I'm not feeding it as a main food).  It does include wheat gluten, corn starch, soy flour, soy protein, and a few other plant-derived ingredients that probably don't belong in great quantities in a cat's diet.  There's also liver in this, pretty high on the ingredients list, so if your cat doesn't seem to like liver, you may want to stay away.  (Mine isn't that picky, as long as it's beef.)\n\nThis food should certainly never be fed to cats with inflammatory bowel disease.

I'm not 100% comfortable giving food like that to my pets so I sadly had to dock of a star.\n\nA couple of interesting tips I'de like to give out about cat food is:\n\n- Cats are carnivores. They need actual meat. Canned cat food comes closet to that. It's been proven that feeding cats wet food will improve their overall health & personality by a great deal. I have to admit that there has been less vomiting, healthy poops, & much more fun & interactive play time with each other & myself. I give half a cup of dry food with half a can of canned food to each cat everyday. [:\n\n- A lot of people have misinterpreted that cats need to graze on food all day. This in fact isn't true at all. Cats are more closely related to their wild cousins; wild cats like lions, cheetahs, cougars, etc, don't eat everyday either because of an unlucky catch or other natural related things. The same theory applies to our domestic feline friends. Feeding cats once a day is plenty for them. Plus it keeps them in shape so they don't over eat!\n\n(I read this in an old National Geographic. I'm also a graduate biological anthropologist).", "summary": "Great canned cat food.", "unixReviewTime": 1319241600}

I know, I know ... the description clearly states that.  I was replacing a long-broken Staywell electronic dog door.  The actual flap opening on this door is about the same size as my old one, possibly a little bit smaller.  But, I had to significantly enlarge the hole in my door in order to install this door.\n\nThe door in question is a steel exterior door with styrofoam insulation.  The door's surface is not flat, as it has three decorative panels across the bottom (the top half has a large window).  After mounting the pet door onto the exterior door, I used a can of \"Great Stuff\" door & window expanding foam insulation to fill the gaps inside the pet door frame due to the recessed panels.  Once the expanding foam hardened, I used an Xacto knife to trim it even with the pet door frame and caulked around it inside and out.  It looks great now that it's done, and I'm confident that no moisture or air should penetrate around the door frame.\n\nHowever, there is definitely a constant draft along the top of the flap, along the flap hinge.  Even when my dogs aren't near the door, meaning that it's locked, a draft can be felt coming through the hinge area.  When my dogs are near, and the door unlocks, there is a draft all around the door flap.  So, keep this in mind if you have a pet that likes to lounge right next to the door ... in cold weather, this will lead to significant energy loss.  As the weather gets very cold, I may just plan to use some 3M (or similar) plastic window insulating film and just let the dogs out.  I'll have to pay attention to our energy bill and how cold the hallway near this door gets as winter arrives.\n\nOverall, the door is exactly what I expected.  I suspect that I would be happier with one of the much more expensive electronic doors (they open more like a power door window), but they are also a lot more expensive and wouldn't have fit my particular door.  If they would have fit my door, I might have considered spending the extra money ... over the long run, it may provide energy savings that make the extra cost worthwhile.", "summary": "Good pet door, may be drafty in cold weather", "unixReviewTime": 1385769600}

If not for that, then I imagine I'd have gotten somewhat frustrated with the unusual assembly process.  Overall, it's pretty sturdy (especially after being screwed down), so my cat only has a bit of trouble climbing down from the higher platforms due to there not being very much ledge extending outward beneath the one she's on (the platforms are staggered, but not by much).

They are relatively large stones about the size of a flattened golf ball. I tossed them into my aquarium hoping that they would be a nice accent against the black background and black sand at the botton of the tank. I let them charge for a few hours with the LED light bar in my aquarium and when I turned out the lights they sure did glow brightly. Also, they look cool under different colors of light. Some of the colors are dim enough (like red) that they still seem to glow. THis is my favorite thing about them. If you have a good adjustable light bar, these are great.\n\nFor the price (I paid 10) they are pretty good. I am giving four stars for two reasons. 1. The color is not distinguishable from the plain old alien green glow of nearly every glow in the dark item I have seen since I was a child. They were labeled \"aqua\" on the packaging, but even in full darkness (none of my lights being on) they appear green, not really blue or aqua at all. 2. Though they are themselves visible in the tank, they do not seem to cast any appreciable light of their own. Maybe I expected too much, but I thought that with a good charge they may illuminate their surroundings enough to see the fish swimming or light up the nearby plants. Of course I know it is unreasonable to think taht these would light up the tank like a light, but a little pool of mysterious light around each one didn't seem to be too much to ask.\n\nDespite these two points, I find the stones (not stones, really, but plastic rock shaped objects) to be heavy, well-made and capable of giving off a little glow for several hours each night after I turn off my tank lights. I am not so sure that these would be my first choice for outdoor use, like to light a walkway, but they may glow for a while each night and mark the edge of a path or something. A great big pile, enough to fill a gravel walkway, would cost a fortune and likely dissappoint.", "summary": "Pretty cool for fishtank use! (I have aqua)", "unixReviewTime": 1469059200}

Overall, I like it better than my hard plastic carrier, but it's too small to keep him in for any long period of time.\n\nWhat I like about the carrier:\n- Lighter than the hard plastic pet carriers.\n- Cheaper than those hard plastic carriers too.\n- A removable soft fleece comes with the carrier which you can attach via velcro to the bottom board (also removable).\n- You can wash the fleece in your washing machine.\n- Carrier has both a side opening for your pet as well as a top opening where you can drop them into the carrier.\n- Quality construction, it will last a long time.\n\nWhat I didn't like about it:\n- There is a leash/clasp inside the carrier which dangles down. I assume that this is for clasping onto a dog's collar so he can't escape quickly. However, this clasp is VERY short and I worry it might choke a poor doggie attached to it. Additionally, if you're not going to use the clasp, there's no way to detach or stow it so it dangles around and bonks your poor pet with the metal clasp. Uncool.\n- The carrier says it's for pets up to 22 lbs. However, as you can see in my photo of Peanut, a 12-lb cat, it's quite cramped for him. He can't stand up inside the carrier. I have no idea how it could hold a 22-lb dog without stuffing him in with a shoe-horn.\n- It's difficult to get the cat into the carrier because the top opening is very narrow & you can bet that the cat's NOT going into the side opening voluntarily - no way, no how! It's probably okay for dogs who can walk into the side opening though.\n\nThe picture shows my 12-lb cat, Peanut, in the carrier at the vet.

It is a simple glass mercury driven thermometer with a green safety mark so it's easy to see if your temperature is in the safe range.  It is large enough to see without being obtrusive.  I used to have a large hang in the side tank that you couldn't miss . . . subtracted from the tank.  You can use the thermometer with or without the plastic suction cup.  The plastic from the suction cup quickly turned from a clear to a milky white.  Not sure why that happened, if it reacted to the warmth of the water or something in the water, but all three did it.  You do have to be careful to make sure the thermometer is high enough in the suction cup or it will pop off the side or pull out of the suction cup.  I found that out of the three I bought, two suction cups work fine, the other refuses to stay on the side regardless of where or in which tank I place it (I have both acrylic and glass tanks).  The thermometer does float in the tank, but the problem is it bobs around so you are never sure where it is, and it's hard to read temperatures without pulling it out (usual problem with mercury thermometers and how the line gets thin or thick depending on where you're viewing it from) so I don't see how you would realistically use this without a suction cup.  I feel like I should buy another one but also feel like even though this was a cheap purchase, it should have worked, and I don't like the idea of giving them more money for a defective unit.", "summary": "Nice but not perfect.

I'm not sure a larger cat would find it comfortable - however recently our larger cat - 18 pounds - has been curling up in one we set on the floor!

We keep one on the bed, but if we leave it on the floor she uses it there.  The kitten likes 'hiding' inside the kup and pouncing things outside of it.  They don't seem territorial over the beds - kitty is still hissing at kitten but curls up right after he's vacated the kup.  She also does not distinguish between the older gray and the new white.  We got two mainly so they'd both be able to curl up at the same time.\n\nOverall these are the best beds I've found for small to mid-sized felines.  I especially like that you can lift the bed, cat and all, and move it to a new sleeping area - all of my kitties have tolerated this.\n\nThe other popular bed in our house is this:\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Simple-Solution-Self-Warming-Thermal-Cat-Cushion-19-Inch-by-23-Inch-Leopard-Print-Beige/dp/B0002HBN16/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Simple Solution Self-Warming Thermal Cat Cushion, 19 Inch by 23 Inch, Leopard Print, Beige</a>\n\n** HAND WASH!!!

My sister gave me a one gallon for a betta, then a 5 gallon for guppies. And then on my 18th birthday I got a 29 gallon! I was so thrilled and did silk plants, but none of my fish seemed happy. 2 years later I rescued a friends fish as she was going to heartlessly flush em to get some hamsters.. I wanted to make the tank PERFECT, So on my first paycheck in my first job ever. I ordered my own plants. And they came from Aquatic discounts. It was their Old 36 plant deal \" No longer done from the looks of things\"\nBut honestly, I was worried like everyone here . Some plants didn't have roots, But I did get a TON more then I ordered.  I came back here to find the order did say many would come as stems. Being a gardener. I know stems mean I could either graph em together into a bush. Or keep them separate and trigger root growth by cutting the first set of leaves and planting up to that point.\n\nThey where droopy for a few days, But soon after growth started. And years past, they grew bigger.. I'm not a fancy aquarium owner. I was a greenhorn. I had No special sub-strait, I don't believe in CO2 boosters. And the light was the same stuff that comes in those tetra aquarium kits at petsmart and stuff. And the growth was slow because of it. But the fish love em. And even now as I graduate them to a 55 gallon. I will still keep dwarf gourami and zebra plecos in my 29 gallon. Because the plants are deeply rooted in my tank. And outside of a water change now and then. It has been a completely self sustainable!\n\nI have just recently bought the 50 plant deal. Knowing I'm more experienced in aquariums and plants. The first ones I obtained took a beating from me and my novice knowledge of Aquariums. But they fought back and now I don't have the heart to move them into the new tank, This is their home. and I'm happy to have them stay there and just get more X3.\n\nAll these posts about yellow \"diseased\" \" Bad packaging\" \" not the amount I ordered\" \"no roots!\"\nIt's so disappointing to see such a great business get attacked time and time again by noobies in the hobby. While I was literally winging it . No research, nothing outside of the gardening skills I learned growing up with a parent who loved landscaping. I'm No College student. Hell I work in a bakery and play video games for a living!\n\nI give this review to the 35 plant kit, as the 36 is no longer available. but also because I don't remember if I did before..\n\nDon't leave bad reviews because you don't know your tweezers from a grasper. Or Chicken poop from Coral powder. Or LED from Christmas lights. The list goes on. If a greenhorn in aquatics can make Every plant grow after shipment and a 7 day wait. As well as a Normal light bulb you'd find in a table lamp anda overstocked 29 gallon. The failure is not on Aquatics.

Collars are easily slipped, and I wasn't at all comfortable walking him in it, even if just around our property.\n\nAlthough I have five rescue dogs of my own, this is my first Puppia Soft Dog Harness; I thought that the soft mesh would be comfortable on his big frame, especially if he turned out to be a puller. The harness is well-made and seems solid and durable. The mesh is strong and the wide, generous design of the harness distributes force over a large area, making for a more comfortable fit, even when hes pulling me along at a swift jog.  (I exaggerate, but not by much.)\n\nThe harness slips on over the dogs head (as other reviewers have cautioned, this opening is NOT adjustable, so be sure to accurately measure your dogs head beforehand!) and you have to lift one leg up and into the shoulder opening to get it on. If your dog doesnt like having her paws handled, you might want to opt for a step-in design instead.\n\nOn the downside, the fabric collects stray fur like whoah, and dry leaves, grass, and burs can be difficult to pick off. Ive washed the harness several times now (hand wash in the sink, air dry) and, while dirt washes out easily, large bits of organic matter tends to stick.\n\nStill, this harness is aces. I like it so much that Im thinking about upgrading some of the other dogs. (Save for Peedee, who really needs a no-pull design; and Mags and Finnick, who freak out when you handle their paws and like their step-in harnesses from Sassy Dog Wear just fine, thankyouverymuch.)", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "03 19, 2014", "summary": "Love it!", "unixReviewTime": 1395187200}

We have a boxer puppy that just loves to bark and neighbors who don't love to hear it.  I really love that this gives out warning vibrations before it actually sends out a shock to the dog.  I was very specific on what I was looking for because I did not want something that would just shock the dog right away without giving it warning.\n\nI know that it takes some time to train the dog what it means when the vibration goes off but ours caught on pretty quick! This collar allows the dog to still give out warning barks so you don't have to be afraid that if someone is approaching your yard or house that your dog won't be able to tell you.\n\nYou can change the intensity so it is custom to your dog.  It also comes with two different length contact points so it's very versatile to many different types of dogs.\n\nThe collar also is adjustable not only through the buckle but where you actually place the shock pack.  You just put it through the two holes and then screw on the contact points for whatever size you choose.\n\nIt came with an extra little blinking safety light you can hang from their collar.  It also has the testing piece to ensure that its working properly before putting it in your dog.  The testing piece also serves as a tool to tighten the contact points!\n\nWhat I also really love about this bark collar is that it is waterproof, so no worries in the rain or bad weather, and its rechargeable so no more going through batteries left and right!!!\n\nWhen you take it out of the box, charge it for a few hours before using it and the LED light will tell you when it's fully charged.  Make sure you read ALL instructions before using to ensure you are using it properly and safely.\n\nI highly recommend this bark collar to anyone looking for a great quality, customizable, and easy to use collar!\n\nI received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Great quality!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1456185600}

Despite having moved and no longer having wood as a concern, we remained in the habit since it really aided in clean-up. Before using the PetProjekt Dogmat, we had a silicone mat which, though grippy, seemed to attract every single piece of hair and dirt in the house! We were very pleased to get the Dogmat, and would like to thank PetProjekt for sending us a sample to review.\n\nAllow me to start by listing the things that I LOVE about this mat:\n\n1) By design, it grips both the floor and any dog bowl with non-slip ridges. Our dog likes to paw at her water bowl when it's empty, which until now would often send it rolling!\n2) It is dishwasher safe - making cleaning it more than easy!\n3) It is BPA and phthalate-free. If and when your dog licks any food or water that spills, they aren't lapping up toxic residues!\n4) It is thick and very durable!\n\nIf I had to list one MINUSCULE issue, it would be that after being shipped (and I assume stored) in a rolled-up fashion, it took a good week or so to properly flatten out. In retrospect, a few heavy books would have helped with the process, but I wanted to mention it so that anyone reading can be prepared. This is the only (very minor) issue with this product, so it gets full marks from me and I highly recommend adding it to your list of possibilities when looking for a new mat!", "summary": "Very pleased!", "unixReviewTime": 1358812800}

We know that a time will come when this ceases to help, but thankfully with this product we now have more quality time with him and he seems happy again.

She's very smart and I've gotten her to stop pulling on the leash.... but if she sees a dog, she goes nuts! She pulls and pulls, and never quite learned to bark, so she makes this odd growling/grumbling noise until she can go \"meet\" the other dog. Then she'll calm down and will lose interest in the other dog quite quickly. But if we can't see the other dog (like if the dog is across the street, etc), she continues to go nuts and pulls, pulls, pulls, until it looks like her eyes are going to pop put of her head. I would often have to pick her up to calm her down and get her to be quiet. It was scary for me, thinking she was going to pass out at any given moment, but also embarrassing because she couldn't keep it together. As soon as I used the harness and leash for the first time, she was like a different dog!!! She initially tried to pull but all it took was a small clicking noise and a 'no, Happy, let's go' and she calmed down! She doesn't huff and puff, doesn't go nuts, and now walking her is extremely enjoyable! I honestly could not be happier.\n\nPROS:\n* Nice colors\n* Good quality\n* Easy to put on\n* Easy to adjust size\n* Affordable/ worth the money\n* No more strain on her neck\n* No more huffing and puffing\n* Keeps my dog calmer, as if the previous collar (regular, everyday collar) was stressing her out even more, causing her to act out more than she normally would.\n* Encourages the dog to stop obsessing over the desired object (car, dog, squirrel), and turn around to make eye contact with you. This has been a huge help for us!\n* Lets the dog know that YOU are in control without hurting/pinching/choking\n* My dog has had no issue getting used to this harness, she seems very comfortable.\n\nCONS:\n* I do wish the leash was adjustable. I'd love to be able to make it longer!\n* The harness is a bit clunky. By that I mean the clasps that snap it together are very big and very dark. I bought the turquoise harness/leash combo and the clasps are huge and black. It looks kind of funny, but no big deal at all.\n\nIt's important to note that this doesn't completely stop your dog from pulling. It's a training tool that greatly decreases pulling... but a lot of it is up to the owner to make the dog understand not to pull! This has been a huge help for us, thank you so much for making such a great product.", "summary": "Love it! Could not be happier.", "unixReviewTime": 1395532800}
