Gonna have to find something else because this won't change the sea of dull black and grey in my car's interior. No shine at all. Fairly easy to work with though. Just time consuming.\n\nEdit: Auto Vinyl Solutions/Ikonwraps is who I purchased this from. These people are the problem. They only carry the ca 421 di noc, and ship this in place of the ca 1170 gloss di noc. I contacted them saying I thought the wrong version was shipped to me and they just told me I was confused. When I called the phone number on the tube I was told that they haven't carried the gloss version for a while. These people are shady online. They blamed the mistakes on Metro Restyling for putting up product pictures. ???  The guy I talked to on the phone was very honest and helpful. Maybe the gloss version is glossy.  I'll have to order some to find out. I thought I already had. I'll update if the gloss is glossy. The 421 looks like and feels like a hologram card where the image shifts from different viewing perspectives.\n\nUpdate 2\nI decided to order the 1080 scotchprint instead. It's much easier to work with than the di noc but is also more delicate. If you want the glossy carbon fiber look get the scotchprint instead. Something else to consider is that the texture is much smoother on the scotchprint which will be much easier to clean. All those little grooves in the di noc pattern will collect dirt and oil. I don't see why anybody would use di noc in their car now that 3m has a better option. It looks better, is easier to work with and will clean much easier.", "summary": "anything but glossy", "unixReviewTime": 1396828800}

This stuff lasted about 3 days tops. It slung all over the side of my truck, looks horrible. I knew it wasn't as good as what I've been using when I sprayed it on, and it stayed wet.

Petersen", "reviewText": "I purchased this pricey WeatherTech Easy-On Stone and Bug Deflector on Amazon two years ago and installed it on my Chevy Sierra.  I purchased it from WeatherTech because they're known for American made, quality merchandise and good customer service.  When it arrived, there were no instructions or fasteners.  The packaging was unimpressive, however the deflector was undamaged. I called WeatherTech and they sent fasteners and instructions within two days.  Their customer service was professional and responsive.\n\nIn the case of my vehicle, the installation was straight forward i.e., insert four plastic mounting nuts into four existing factory holes in the underside of the hood.  Place the guard on the hood and use four provided sheet metal screws and rubber grommets to secure the guard in place.  The product fits well, looks good and has an impressive finish.  The whole installation takes 10 minutes.\n\nOver the following two years of use, I found the claim that these guards deflect bugs and stones from striking both your hood and windshield to be rather subjective as there's really no way to determine if they actually work.  I assume that they probably help to a minor degree just from their presence, but I suspect that most who buy these (included myself) would say that they work only because they don't want to admit that they bought it, installed it and found they couldn't determine if it served any real purpose other than to add some bling.\n\nThe reason for my low rating of this deflector is this:\n\nThe method by which it attaches to the vehicles hood is of a very poor design.  Within two years after installation, the plastic around all four of the attachment points fractured and eventually broke through.  Here's why:\n\nEach time you close your hood the deflector takes an impact shock.  That shock must be absorbed by four small fastener points and, as a result, stresses the plastic around those points.  With each hood closure the shock is repeated and, eventually, the plastic around the attachment points shatter.  The installation instructions advise you to not over-tighten the screws (which I followed to the letter), but I view this warning only as an 'escape clause' on their part to relieve them from the liability of their poor design.  I threw mine away and again purchased the identical deflector, but this time from AVS, paying $20 less.\n\nWhen I mounted the new guard I didn't follow their instructions.  Instead, instead I took a different approach.  I first applied 3M double-sided exterior adhesive tape to the hood where the guard makes contact.  I taped only those areas between the fastener heads to ensure that the entire surface area across the hood and guards contact points remained even and there were no high or low pressure points.  This is important so that no uneven stress points are created.  I put the guard in place, pressed it into the tape for a few minutes and found that it had a very solid feel, adhering firmly to the hoods surface along its entire length.  I inserted the four screws using four washers that I'd modified into 'long washers' by grinding down two sides, ending up with a long rectangular washer that spread the force of the screw head over a wider area of the guards surface.  I tightened these only to the point that the washer would not move under the screws head.  (The screws should only be viewed as a back up in the event that the tape fails.)  I let the tape cure and bond for 24 hours before closing the hood.  When I closed the hood, I noted a significant difference.  The guard felt like it was a part of the hood and very solid.  Hopefully, I'll get more use out of this one than I did the last.\n\nA note regarding the WeatherTech Easy-On Stone and Bug Deflector:  WeatherTech does not make the hood guards they sell.  The WeatherTech logo is placed on their guards by the real manufacturer i.e., AVS - Lund International (Auto Vent Shade), which holds the patent for this particular design.  You can by this guard directly from AVS on Amazon for about $20 less.", "summary": "Poorly designed mounting points failed after two years.", "unixReviewTime": 1467676800}

This was in January 2017.  These lights have a 1-year warranty and here I am 2-3 months beyond that when I noticed this issue.  Here in California we have had a severe drought throughout almost all of that warranty period.  Then in late 2016 and early 2017 we are now experiencing vast amounts of rain.  That's when the problem began....as soon as we started getting lots of rain.  I contacted the company, Auto Lights & Bulbs (which happens to be based here in California apparently), and described this issue.  I felt that given I was only a couple months past the warranty period & given the facts about the rain here in California, that they might replace them as a matter of good customer service.  The response was short: \"Your over the 1-year warranty.\"  Not even a \"sorry you had a problem.\"  I responded back asking for reconsideration given the circumstances.  After waiting several days I finally got a response which was basically the same.  I asked to be connected to a supervisor.  The company never responded back.  While I understand the 1-year warranty period and the need for a company to limit that time period, I strongly believe as a matter of customer service (given the facts as described) that Auto Lights & Bulbs should have replaced them.  The terse \"your past the 1-year warranty,\"  slow response to my inquiries and finally not providing me with supervisor contact information leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  Poor product and poor customer service.  If you decide to buy these from this company I strongly suggest buying some automotive silicone or other sealant and seal everywhere possible yourself since they apparently did not seal them properly.", "summary": "**LEAKED**LEAKED**LEAKED", "unixReviewTime": 1485734400}

The driving light circuit is extremely dim, and the brake light circuit disables the dim driving light circuit and only illuminates the tip of the light which is not so good compared to other LED lights on the market. I _strongly_ discourage anyone from ordering this product.\n\nI have compared 3 different LEDs and here is my report:\n\"1157 Bay15D 18 SMD 5050\" (Amazon item B004C8L1AE) I give this a 10 out of 10 for the driving light circuit, 9 out of 10 for the brake light circuit, and 10 out of 10 for flood/spread. This is by far my favorite light I've used. It is more pricy but it has the best performance. Both circuits are brighter than my original incandescent light bulb and it has EXCELLENT flood/spread of the light.\n\"1157 RED 48 LED Light\" (Amazon item B002SD8BMQ) I give this a 7 out of 10 for the driving light circuit, a 10 out of 10 for the brake light circuit, and a 8 out of 10 for flood/spread. This is a great product but just as others have reported, they do not last long and many LEDs begin to stop working. Within 1 week the driving circuit of 1 of my bulbs stopped working, so I was at risk of getting a ticket for a missing tail light. As for the brake light circuit, it is very bright, even brighter than the SMDs listed above, but unfortunately also after just 1 week some of the LEDs would stop working and they of course would loose their brightness. I do not recommend these because they are UNRELIABLE. The driving light circuit is as bright or maybe slightly less bright than my original incandescent light bulb, but the brake light circuit is much brighter than my original incandescent light bulb. They do flood pretty well, but not as good as the SMDs which are much more reliable.\n\"1157 White 20 LED Light(2 bulbs) ba15d\" (Amazon item B0017L7E9Q) I give this a 1 out of 10 for the driving light circuit, a 4 out of 10 for the brake light circuit, and a 1 out of 10 for flood/spread. (this is a white led version). These lights are complete GARBAGE. I cannot recommend these to anyone. They are a complete joke. Both circuits are less bright than my original incandescent light bulb, and they do not flood at all. They have the worst spread/flood, they are worthless. All you see when the brake circuit comes on is a very small diameter concentration of light at your brake lens, and for the driving light circuit you cannot even tell they are on unless it is very dark outside. I imagine you will get a ticket for not having bright enough driving lights. Horrible product, please do not purchase this. You do not have to learn the hard way.\n\nKeep in mind that these LED light companies, in my experience, are very sneaky: They only give you 2 or 3 days to return these products. So you only have a very small window of time to receive, test, and then try to return them because they will likely not give you a refund at all.\n\nIn conclusion, pony up the extra bucks and get yourself a SMD-type LED bulb. SMDs are brighter, have the best light spread/flood, and are the most reliable. If you cannot afford SMD lights, then I think you should wait for the technology to become affordable because you will spend $$ on other lights that do not work or will not last, and then you will end up putting your original lights back in at a complete loss. Honestly, you should wait until you can afford SMD lights or not switch to LED lights at all. - My 2 cents", "summary": "These lights are a COMPLETE JOKE.", "unixReviewTime": 1320883200}

But once I got it, I found that it uses too \"aggressive\" charging algorithm.\n\nFor instance, once I plugged it to a Motorcraft battery (it is installed in a car that was just driven for an hour), it starts applying increasingly high voltage - it starts from about 13V, and in several minutes got to almost 16V (I used a multimeter to access the voltage at the battery terminals).  The charger display would show 12V - irrespective of the actual voltage, so it does not help at all. In about 30 min the charger illuminated green LED signifying end of the charge, and kept about 16V in this \"floating mode\".\n\nI used a different charger (B&D BC15BD) on the same \"charged\" battery afterwards, and it starts with classic \"constant current, then top off with decreasing current\" charging scheme, and it took about 12 hours (at 15A) to get to the top off stage, where it kept 14.7V at the battery for another  hour (with decreasing current)  to get to the floating mode.  So clearly those 2 chargers take a very different approach to the battery charging - now the question is which one to trust.\n\nTo figure this out, I used SC-1200A on a  different car battery (Toyota True Start)  - it  did not want to be charged this fast even at applied 16V, and to my horror I could hear boiling water  inside the tray, even after I limited charging current to 3A (!).  BC15BD used on the same battery did not exhibit this behavior, but took a long time to top if off.\n\nAt this point I decided to give up SC-1200A as it has too \"aggressive\" (16V is too high according to the many sources I could find on-line) and to my estimate a very inaccurate way to charge a car battery.", "summary": "\"Aggressive\" and innacurate charging scheme", "unixReviewTime": 1426291200}

According to California Custom, the combination of the Aluminum Deoxidizer and Purple Polish are supposed to cut your polishing time in half.  They advise that you use the green deoxidizer first, followed by the Purple Metal Polish. They describe the Purple Metal Polish as a, \"truly no-rub metal polish\". These claims are simply not true!\n\nAs far as I can tell, the Deoxidizer is little more than a mild cleaner. It does little, if anything, to speed up the polishing process. The Purple Metal Polish works well, but no better than similar products that sell for less than half the price. As far as the \"no rub\" claim, forget it. You apply and use this product just as you would any other metal polish.  In other words, you have to work it into the surface until the top oxide layers are gone.  Depending on the original condition of the metal and the shine desired, this may take considerable effort. In fact, if the metal is too far-gone you may have to start with progressively finer grits of wet / dry sand paper.\n\nBottom line, in my opinion, the Aluminum Deoxidizer is a total waste of money and the Purple Metal Polish is no better or worse than any other quality metal polish.  It is however, one of the most expensive. Personally, I've had great results with BlueMagic 400 Metal Polish Cream, which currently sells for $4.35.  Mothers also makes a good polish at a similar price.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/BlueMagic-400-Metal-Polish-Cream-7-oz/dp/B000BO8Z9I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">BlueMagic 400 Metal Polish Cream - 7 oz.</a>\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Mothers-05106-Billet-Metal-Polish-4-oz/dp/B000COU7LG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mothers 05106 Billet Metal Polish - 4 oz</a>", "summary": "Exaggerated claims and over priced!", "unixReviewTime": 1346716800}

The power lead is long enough to reach from most cigarette lighters to all of your vehicle's wheels and a little bit beyond.  The motor runs, the pump pumps, air goes in, your tire pressure rises.  All good so far.\n\nIt also has a little storage compartment for the power cord and air hose.  Neat!\n\nThat's as far as it goes for the pros.\n\nCons:\nNoisy: You won't want to use this at 3am when you're trying not to disturb the neighbors\n\nCheap/not durable: Not just plastic, CHEAP plastic, flexes a lot, doesn't seem like the casing would survive rough conditions.  Even the cord feels thin and easily sliced or broken\n\nDim light: Don't even bother with the little red emergency light, dim old-style flashlight bulb, How about a CREE or similar LED.  My LED flash on my phone puts out 10X more light than this does.\n\nBulky: This isn't the first 12V compressor I've had, it's similar hardware to my last one but twice as big. That plastic case feels at least half empty.  Wasting space in the trunk.\n\nGauge didn't work right on mine: I probably got a bad one, but the gauge read out works, and the buttons work in some cases, but reset didn't work, auto-shutoff didn't work, and since I couldn't reset the gauge it started at 6.5psi, meaning I had to subtract 6.5psi from the readout as I filled it.  Instead of 32.5psi, I filled it to 39.  It worked, but was annoying.\n\nSlow: Slow, but that's typical with these small emergency inflators.  going from 26.5psi to 32.5psi on a tire on my Dodge Charger took about 4-5 minutes.\n\nRecap; It'll refill your tire.  If you find yourself low on air and needing to boost tire pressure, you'll be glad to have this thing.  99.9% of the rest of the time, you'll be wanting to chuck it in the dumpster.

Both pairs are great and I use them very often.  I needed another set, and liked the way the locking pin works on the 6 Tons, so I thought I would give these a try.\n\nSo why the three star rating?  Well, the pair I received - the pins were not aligned properly making them both a pain to use and moreover unsafe to use.  When I would raise the jack to height, and attempted to slide the pin in, it would not slide without lifting the extension arm with the other hand and \"finagling\" the pin into position.  Think about that for a minute - typically, I slide the jack underneath the car (which is still being held up by the floor jack), and I then slide the arm up to height, and insert the pin.  Note that I try to get this done quickly as the car is still only floor jack supported.  With these, I would have to find the height, and then have to try and use two hands while lying down under the car to jimmy the pin into alignment with two hands.  I did this once and realized these were not made correctly.  Not sure how these got through QC - then again, seems like lots of things get through \"QC\" these days....\n\nSo why didn't I just exchange them as QC issues happen all the time?  Well, I tried two sets and both sets had pin alignment issues.  Enough for my blood - I just was not one of the lucky ones I guess.  Two for two with issues on both are just plain bad odds.... besides, I am trying not to support companies that allow such blatant QC issues \"slip through\" for public consumption.  As a result, I probably won't be buying anymore Torin Jack Stands - and take solace in the fact I have two good stands already.  Let's face it - two for two on defective products is more than chance.\n\nSadly, I was not happy with these - and I really wanted them to work out.", "summary": "Didn't work out after trying two sets - the pins were not aligned, and would not slide in cleanly - both inconvenient and unsafe", "unixReviewTime": 1449100800}

I used a Dewalt 7/9\" polisher with a Dewalt semi-flexible backing pad.  Tried several different types of pad, including; smooth foam, ribbed foam and wool bonnets.  At best the result was mediocre with no real improvement evident even on light areas of oxidation.  Rubbing by hand with a Turtlewax cut and polish from Walmart did a better job!\n\nI then changed direction and tried  Meguiar's M6732 Marine/RV One Step Compound - 32 oz.  I had low expectations after the poor result of the expensive 3M product but I have to say that the Maguiars product worked like magic!  After an afternoon with the Dewalt polisher my boat looks brand new!

The put a 14mm wrench on the tensioner...then take a 1/2\" ratchet and fit into the open end of your wrench....now you will have plenty of leverage, good bolt engagement and plenty of clearance.  Slip the belt onto the lower pulley and spin the crank pulley to get it the rest of the way.  I ended up rounding off the teeth on this tool.  Like stated above, I used my own tools snd sent this tool packing.", "summary": "No work for 02-05 CRV", "unixReviewTime": 1454025600}

Flow rate: Once you open the air valve and pump the handle a few times to prime it does flow fairly well. Takes about 14minutes to empty, well not empty, since you cant get the last gallon or so due to the hose location. Also helps if you don't breathe around the hose as it doesn't take anything to kink it and make the fuel flow stop. The main reason for my low review is that my handle just gave out. I have owned this for two summers and have filled/emptied maybe a dozen times for my boat. The handle started pouring gas out yesterday, so another repair part is pending.

If the car is maybe just dusty, it's ok, but if it needs scrubbing, this oversized square that's hard to grip isn't as effective as a regular mit. The soap is OK, but I have found that Chemical Guys' soaps quickly strip their wax products off, so you either wax far more often, or use a wash/wax product from a competitor to maintain the waxing using their wax products. The Gamma Seal lid is nice, but overkill for this bucket, so I used it elsewhere on a storage bucket. A simple snap on/off lid would have been better.

Next, I was instructed to follow a link.  I did this and it updated by GPS. However, I had no map of Canada.  I spent about 2 and a half hours on the phone, and learned in bits and pieces that a purchase takes 4 or 5 days to clear. At that time, I can download the map.  It took a couple more calls, the incompetent people will not pass you on.  You have to hang up on them and call back into the cue.  Anyway, when your payment clears, one is not informed as to when this occurs, you are suppose to be able to update your GPS and the map will appear.  Unfortunately, we are leaving from Canada in two days (we are currently 50 miles from the border).  I would never buy another TomTom product.\nI purchased this unit while traveling at a retail store.  We were in a small town in Kansas, and there were a few problems, but it was a small town with minor roads.  I spent more than 3 hours to update the maps and software.  In Austin, TX, I headed out for a shopping center that has been in existence for at least 12 years.  When I put the address in, a 9901 number, it indicated that no address greater than 6600, was acceptable.  There are other problems and short comings  in its use compare to our old Garmin which lost its mind, and cost money to update.  I attempted to use the website for support on the issues I had.  First off, it will not recognize my password.  So, I went to the 'forgot your password' option.  Reset, and thought all is well.  When I attempted an email, I had to re-login, and yes, it would not accept my password.  Sometimes, the website does not recognize the model I have, a Start 50M.  It shows only 3 Start models.  This morning, the website showed a bunch.  I selected my model and proceeded only to be kicked out again on my password.  The several emails that I managed to solicit were mostly automatic.  The one that may have been sent by a person was patronizing.  It merely suggested that I repeat the update process (of 3 hours plus time).  I am headed to a store in Austin for a refund.  I did purchase the extended warranty which may be helpful.  There was one plus, unlike Garmin, the TomTom is mindful of sending you on gravel roads.

It went off and stayed off after I turned the car off / on again a few minutes later.\n\nDid 120+ miles towing a popup one way a few hours later without issue, but on the way back approaching a stop I noticed my turn signal indicator was lighting up when I braked.  Turning left from that stop, my ABS light came on.  So this has gone from intermittent to reliably: use left turn signal, initiate ABS light until car is restarted.  Press brake, illuminate turn signal indicator on the dash.\n\nJust threw a P1780 check engine light today and also noticed the [R] light of my gear indicator on the dash was now faintly lighting up when I applied the brake, 4 days/250 miles after installation.  This code is for 'Park/Neutral position switch sensor failure'.  I can't help but think these things are all connected in some way.

Conveniently had yet another new one to replace it with and magically the problem was gone 100%.  Skeptical of my success, I went for a 15 minute problem-free test drive until I was 1/4 mile from home - braked for a stop light and my left turn signal indicator just briefly lit up and occasionally lit up the rest of the way as I braked.

The bulb wasn't out when I looked so I'm guessing it'll follow the same pattern of intermittent issues to constant to CEL when the bulb shorts.\n\nTL;DR: I think the internals of mine are not well.

The issue is that this bulb is LONG. The actual bulb itself is longer, and the LED lighting element is deeper into the lens ( projector type ). So the focus is WAAAAY off. Tragically short. Without exaggeration, the usable light path is 25 feet.  It is 1/3 of a standard H7 bulb and 1/4 of an HO Off Road bulb. The side-by-side comparison was absolutely pathetic.  The light source is just too far ahead of the reflector and that shortens the focal point dramatically. I almost hit a Bicyclist tonight pulling into my own drive..he was completely in the dark.  I measured the height of the beam cut-off..it's dead-on stock. It just has no brightness..it just fades away to nothing.  So out they come after 2 hours of use ( and 2 hours of install time...) and in go the Osram H7 Off-Road HO bulbs.\n\nCan't return them, I waited a couple weeks for decent weather to do the install...so I'm out of the return window.

The biggest negative point though, the bar mount is total trash. It spins around the bars any time you push either of the buttons, so you have to hold the button mold still from behind while using it.\n Also, it doesn't always connect or make contact \"inside\" the switch weatherproofing. If it didn't work at all, i'd drop a star, but it technically works so it BARELY earns that second star. Get a thin piece of tire tube, or some sticky-to-metal material like rubber, to go between the mount and your bars, else it's a major waste of time/money.\n\nI recommend researching other products heavily before choosing this product.", "summary": "Trash mount setup hurts this as a useful option.", "unixReviewTime": 1423353600}

We could barely see the display due to reflections on the screen.  We still had our older nuvi 1450 in the car so we put them next to each other.  After checking the brightness setting on both, the 1450 definitely has a brighter display than the 2597.  In fact, by dimming the 1450, we determined that the 2597 display brightness was about 60% of the 1450.  The display background on the 1450 is bright white, where the 2597 has gone to an off-white or light grey with streets highlighted in white.  That seems to add to the display issue.  In most cases, the difference is probably not a problem.  But the 2597 display will have a hard time overcoming sunlight on the screen or reflected light on the screen from inside the vehicle on a bright day.  We had one of those cheap visors from Amazon that helps with direct sunlight.\n\nI still have an ongoing complaint about these units and that's the way it announces and displays upcoming turns.  It may say to turn on 1st Street which in fact may be true in the local jurisdiction you're driving, but in fact is also US41.  1st Street may or may not be identified by a street sign, but US41 definitely will be.  Always good to do your homework to be sure you're turning where you want to, especially if towing.\n\nI don't have any experience with its Bluetooth capability.

Misleading advertising you may think you are getting a battery revitalizer but above 11.5v it's only a charger. Best you don't allow your battery to become discharged that badly anyway as it can shorten it's life. Other brands are available that desulfate 100% of operating time but they cost more, such as B@tteryMinder 1500,1510 (Considering battery prices, I say they would be worth the added cost) and Xtreme XC100-P. If you decide to buy this unit you should monitor it with a voltmeter to make sure that after the initial charge to 14.4 volts it does not drift below 12.5 volts before cycling back into charge mode, because there has been an issue with these allowing batteries in their care to become discharged. It may need to be unplugged briefly to reset before it starts charging again. That's why it can't be trusted as a maintainer. It could likely be a dependable maintainer if it were put on a timer to give it some off time each day, to cause it to reset. In spite of all that, it is a multi-stage, energy efficient and safe machine for charging 12v motorcycle, lawn tractor, car n light truck batteries, whether standard flooded or AGM type. Will not overcharge.\n\nFor you DIYers- Build your own maintainer for less that is likely to out-perform this thing since the float mode works when it wants to on these. Buy a 13.5vdc switching adapter (preferably at least 2amp) and connect it to your 12v Lead-acid battery, can be left on indefinitely. Considerations- May need to use a resistor like a 12v, 55watt bulb (or similar) in one output lead to prevent overloading adapter till the charge level rises in battery.  Alternately you can use a 14v adapter and a blocking diode in one output lead between adapter and battery, which will drop it about 0.6v to 13.4, which has the added benefit of eliminating the possibility that any current will ever backfeed to the adapter or discharge the battery if it is unplugged. Both these setups are great for giving a slow, gentle charge to 100%, and extending the life of a battery. You see, a fully charged wet cell 12v battery left idle for long enough to dissipate surface charge will measure about 12.7v. however once it is partly discharged from starting your car, your car's alternator will hold constant voltage around 14.2 or more to bring the charge level up in the short time you drive before it's shut off. But if time is not an issue, constant 13.5v will also bring it up to 100% after a day or 2, without the water losses associated with higher charging voltages. Since this method is both less costly and often more dependable than a commercial unit, I think it's a win-win. Works great. But it does require some assembly.", "summary": "These don't live up to the hype.", "unixReviewTime": 1432598400}

I wouldn't waste the $300.\n\nDO you homework first.  View their website forums at [...].  I spent many nights there and with their technical support.  In the end it is about your perseverance and their patience.  Occasionally you get lucky, but as you will see from the help forum, most don't.  Now that I know all the tricks (for my own vehicle only!!!!) I am comfortable with changing the settings on my trucks computer.  There are other models out there and I have no idea about them, so for now I will stick it out with these guys.", "summary": "OK where to begin", "unixReviewTime": 1349654400}

It turnsout, the Mako Saddles cost less than this lock housing (4ea needed) when combined with euro lock key system (4ea needed). I see this as an insult to ones intelligence. I actually cannablized our other car's  racks to determine where this lock system is not that necessary so that i could minimize having to purchase additional locks, in other words, i essentially cross loaded locks between several complete yakima systems.

I hope yakima has this realization. Now that my son is attempting to reintegrate back to the community after a year's combat tour in Afghanistan and needs a roof rack system, i will not recommend yakima system but instead, proactively purchase a brand other than yakima. Yakima quality is great but paying more for locks than the component to be secured is utterly ridiculous. I should have just drilled a couple holes and utilized padlock, this might be \"hack\" but sensible because paying almost $140 for 4 locks is idiotic; mako saddles costs less.

I saw these as a great upgrade option because of the reviews and I'm a fan of the halo look on Jeeps. They came in and installed extremely easily - essentially just a plug-and-play. Unfortunately, if you're installing these on a TJ (1997-2006), the included fuse tap harness for the halos has to be plugged into the fusebox behind the glovebox in order to get the functionality you're looking for. If you try to plug it into a fuse in the engine bay, the halos will remain on regardless if the key power is on or not. So I cut the wire, passed it through the firewall, and then soldered it back together. I plugged it into the fuse labeled \"SPARE\" in the owners manual (I can't remember the fuse number) and now the halos function perfectly as DRLs with the key turned on. You'll also need a matching fuse for whichever fuse you choose to tap. The \"SPARE\" fuse is a 20A if I remember correctly and I had to purchase that separately. The white halos are bright and look clean. These lights also include yellow halos that use another included harness that splices into the turn signal lights but I opted not to install this option after using the headlights. The actual headlights I found are not very bright at all. With the halos and headlights on, it actually looks like the halos are brighter. The beams they produce are uneven, undefined, and somewhat splotchy. The high beams are also poor in that they produce a pattern of three beams slightly above the headlight beams which are not much brighter than the headlights. Also, these lights don't illuminate roads, dirt, foliage, trees, etc. well. They seem to illuminate road paint and road signs very brightly and, when driving in pitch blackness, drowns your vision of the actual road and anything that may be on it. This may be due to the fact that the lights produce more of a bluish light than a white light. After about two weeks, I have determined that my stock headlights actually function better and I may soon switch back. I haven't had any problems so far with leaks or moisture getting in the lenses but I haven't had them very long. I'm giving 3 out of 5 stars because I only paid $106 and everything aside from another fuse was included for installation. They also look great from the third person. But I'd go with something else if you're looking for something brighter and more functional.\n\nPros: refreshed modern look, easy to install, included wiring.\nCons: lacks brightness, awful beam patterns.", "summary": "Great for looks, poor for vision.", "unixReviewTime": 1519084800}

The package arrived within a couple of days. Removing the mount is an easy process and a very good video can be found on YouTube easily. At first the new one seemed almost exactly the same with a slightly lower grade aluminum and a slightly different mold but not too far off from the original. As I put it in place I discovered to my horror that it did not fit. The lower bracket bolt holes were an inch away from where they should have been. I compared the parts closer and realized that the rubber mount was on the bracket backwards from the original. The original on my 2007 Mazda 3 2.3L has a slight elbow extension on the rear facing side of the bracket and a straight side facing to the front of the car with the mount coming out the left side toward the engine. You can see in the photo here on Amazon the exact correct orientation of the mount and the bracket. The one I received from AutoPartPro however had the bracket facing the opposite direction. Fortunately, I was able to remove the rubber mount portion by prying the rubber coated metal reinforced claws on the bottom and pounding the mount out with a mallet. At first I thought I'd just replace the mount in the same bracket facing the right direction but found that the bracket was also molded with a slight degree of angle in the opposite direction from the original preventing the engine bolts from fitting as well. So I removed the rubber mount again and put it in the original bracket with the correct degree of angle (toward the engine). To my surprise it still didn't appear to fit. The video I watched did warn (but did not show) that the engine may need to be lifted further in order to fit. I lifted the engine and was able to get the bolts through enough to get the nuts back on. The pressure from tightening the nuts brought the whole thing back together and all was normal again. The part has only been on for a week now, no trouble so far. Since the construction of the item is nearly exact to the original I expect close to the same amount life from it.

The Stihl MS 170 in the image looks like a pretty tight (good) fit but a MS 170 swims in this boot. I can put my MS 290 with a 20\" bar in the boot with room to spare. The boot is huge compared to my MS 171 (same physical size as a MS 170). This was a good attempt by Kolpin to provide a protective saw mount but it misses badly on the proper sizing for what most people will carry on an ATV. I put my MS 290 in it and went out on a trail and observed the mount flexing which will lead to mount failure quite rapidly I assume. Thats all good that it will hold a 290 but all I take on my \"quad\" as general provision is a MS 171 with a 14\" bar for trail maintenance and the occasional small log. When using it for the MS 171 I noted the saw was chafing on the boot because the boot is way to big for the saw...eventually either the boot will rub through or the saws gas tank will develop a hole. With space being at a premium on a quad (ATV) this boot takes up too much space for what it offers. If it were sized appropriately for a small saw I would likely call it awesome but its pretty much a space hog and not worth what it offers in my opinion. Another thing I noted when running with the MS 290 secured in it was my Honda 420 Rancher actually was tilting (listing) on the suspension toward to side where the saw was mounted...that is a bad thing as balance of load is key when riding trails on a quad. I think I'll stay with strapping my saw down to the front rack as I always have and perhaps mount this Kolpin Saw Boot to my trail trailer and give that a try. Disappointed with the boot and the Photo-shopped image that compelled me to buy it.

This is very good as the cover will not slide around and move easily on my leather seats.\nIt rolls up nicely and gets stored under the driver's seat in seconds and I don't even bother anymore to use the elastic loops included (as they got stretched out quickly -probably from Summer heat in the car). The stitching (as little as there is) is straight and well done. I could do away with the printed graphics in lieu of embroidery (for the price).\nI was concerned about how the neoprene would react against my brown leather and was very careful in using it for incrementally longer periods of time, including at high temperatures and always with leather cleaner and conditioner at hand. Although I did not (and will not) leave it on the seat mid-summer, I put it on and used it while the car was very hot under the summer sun with no ill effects. I have no reason to believe it would damage the seats if left on, but why take the chance?!\n\nI was tempted to mention pricing as a negative. Neoprene is not that expensive and this piece involves very limited labor in the way of stitching. However, I feel this will last quite a while, making it worth for me and -understandably- a low repeat revenue stream for the vendor.\n\nThe only negative aspect I had to fix involves the \"shoulders\". While the rest of the cover sits nice and flat against the seat, the shoulders will quickly flop forward under their own weight. Quicker (like 5 minutes) once/if the neoprene is warm. I ended up stitching a strip of nylon strap with velcro to hold the shoulders behind the seat.", "summary": "Well worth the price and useful as heck!

The mirrors have a snug adjustment, but that's a good thing becuase they don't bounce around very much while going down the road.  Some towing mirrors really vibrate while you're traveling and that can be pretty annoying after awhile.\n\nThere are 4 peices to each mirror.  The mirror itself, the wedge bar to hold the mirror in place, and the bolt that applies pressure to the wedge to make sure the mirror doesn't move while driving down the road.  There's also a peice of stick on felt for the wedge bar so it doesn't rub your mirror.\n\nI had 2 problems with the design.\n\n1) The set srew that you turn to apply presure and hold the mirror in place was fine on the one mirror, but on the other mirror there was some much resistance when turning it that I thought I was going to snap the turn handle off.  After several slow attempts with some WD40 applied, it finally turned all the way in.  After a couple of installations the bolt has loosened a little and seems to be fine now.\n2) Wedge bar felt strip requires trimming, so it isn't cut to fit out of the box.  While this is a minor thing, it's still kind of a pain.  The other problem is that the wedge bar is loose when the mirrors aren't in use, so if you aren't careful you could loose the wedge and then the mirror would be useless.  The bolts stay in just fine due to friction, but I don't like having loose unattached peices on something like this becasue it never fails that at some point one of them will go missing and will probably happen while on the road.\n\nOverall these mirrors work well, I just wish they were designed a little differently.", "summary": "Did the job, but the products not perfect", "unixReviewTime": 1403654400}

I finally got it going on an old Windows 7 32-bit machine. The driver will not install on a 64 bit machine.  At first, the antivirus said it detected a virus from the driver installation and it removed a file.  As a result, when I tried to connect to my Corolla, I got nothing but cable connection errors.  After quite a bit of internet research, I learned that a lot of antivirus products will flag the cable driver file (.dll file) as a virus, and without this file, the software will not find the cable.  Many posts have stated this is a false positive.  With that in mind, I turned off the antivirus, reinstalled the driver, and lo and behold... I finally connected to the car.  I was able to turn off the stupid and annoying seat belt beeps, although you can't turn off the light on the dash.  I also did some other custom changes and all of them worked.  You can also add an OEM remote and transponder key, although I haven't done that.  In all, it was definitely worth the $20.  Now some tips:\n1.  First connect the cable to the PC, then open the techstream program, connect the OBD end to the car, turn the key to ignition without turning on the car, and click to connect the vehicle.  At least that's the way I did it and it worked.\n2.  If you're worried that your antivirus says it detected a virus, it's up to you to decide if you move on.  I turned off the AV to install the driver, and I haven't had any problems changing vehicle settings, so I'd say it's indeed a false positive.\n3.  Some comments say it'll only work on XP, but for me it worked on Win 7, although it does need to be 32 bit.  There are workarounds online to make it work with 64 bit, but most of them say to extract the contents of the driver program with WinRar.  My CD did not have the files zipped, so I couldn't extract anything.  At any rate, it's working.  Sure beats the hassle and cost of going to the dealer to change some of this stuff.  And actually, they might even refuse to change some of it due to \"safety\" reasons, like the seat belt chime.", "summary": "Working well on a 14 Corolla.", "unixReviewTime": 1474761600}

But if you have a polished case it is a miracle product. It removes super fine scratches so easily, and I actually have taken out fairly deep scratches with it successfully.\n\nI dropped my favorite watch and put a series of marks in the case from the fall. Some people say stuff like this adds character, but in this case it just looked awful. It took hours, but I was able to get it out entirely, but even under the brightest light you cannot see anything...looks brand new. I just went very slowly and carefully, and it worked the marks completely out. I will say though, you are going to need patience (or OCD) because it might take a while for more major issues like this.\n\nIn short, these are super handy for watch case clean-up.

It took 5-10 min to finish but everything went well. I am impressed this is much better than my prior experience with another Innova scanner.\n\nI have mixed feeling about Free Repair Solutions website. Whatever is available there is of some value but it is really trying to subscribe you to the premium Paid services. I am not against paying for help, but there are many sites that provide you with suggested repair based on DTC. I do not know without any comparison if Repair Solutions is the best or the worst of them and if prices are comparable.\n\nUpdate 04/26/13 - I have received an email informing of the available software upgrade to add Nissan/Infinity , Kia and Hyundai brands for free and German's for $99.\nI will advise how this will install on my unit.\n\nThis is the new tool. I had 3160 for over 2 years and this one provides more functions and, what is even more important, covers more brands in OBD, ABS and body categories.\nWorks very well on a few vihicles I tried it on.\nIt is very easy to use similar to other Innova products but has more features and gets you better data especially with PC based module.\nI have never had a reason to use software supplied with 3160. The software supplied with this product is actually useful. It is browser based but the data and the program runs on your computer. Not only it will print a report that you can hand to a customer but it will store the data for future retrieval.  The scanner/software will pull Vehicle ID and some other information from the vehicle computer automatically so that you can follow up on recalls and such\n\nNow why I do not give it 5 stars:\n1. It does not cover Nissan in ABS and manufacturer specific codes. This is a very popular make and it is a shame not to include its diagnostic codes. Nobody else has German makes so cannot complain about those.\n2. The software on the scanner and PC claimed to be easy to update, however my experience with 3160 is that the company never supplies any updates. You will have whatever you bought. In 2 years I owned 3160 it had few upgrades but I have never been able to upgrade my unit.\nThe only way to upgrade is thru PC based Innova program and in 2 years I tried, it always responded \"you have the latest version\" - what a bunch of xxxx.\nAlso there is no stand alone \"upgrade\" installation program to install an upgrade on the scanner if you can get the latest software elsewhere.", "summary": "Best in its class", "unixReviewTime": 1364428800}

I wasn't sure what my vehicle had, so I just bought an assortment of valves and this tool and hoped for the best.\n\nI don't even need to tell you the punch line, do I?  Come to find out, my low-side valve is a JRA valve (which I think is also called a high-flow Schrader valve) which is too big to fit through this tool.  I read other reviews that say the Mastercool 5831 model does work with JRA valves (its $30 more) so I ordered that (thank you Amazon same-day delivery!) and it worked like a champ.  Basically, the 81490 kit will work for the skinny valve cores, but not the fat valve cores.\n\nIm not going to fault the tool because of my ignorance on the subject of car AC repair.  Its well built and Im sure would have no problems installing valves for which it was designed.  I did not use the tool, but its all metal construction and built just as well as the Model 58531 which worked great.\n\nUnsure what you have and don't want to make the same mistake I did?  I guess you could just buy the 5831 kit and know that it handles all types of valves.  If you don't want to spend any more money than you need to, make sure you buy the right tool for your type of valve:  I found that polarbearinc.com/Webstore/index.cfm?fuseaction=category.display&category_ID=80 has pretty good descriptions of the various types of valve cores that are out there.\n\nIf your research tells you that this tool will fill your needs, I think youll be happy with it.", "summary": "Good tool, but not for JRA valve cores", "unixReviewTime": 1436745600}

{"reviewerID": "AA3D4OHRHDCBO", "asin": "B000GU3KHO", "reviewerName": "Richard", "verified": true, "reviewText": "I leave my old BMW airhead parked on the streets of San Francisco year round, and try to keep it covered most of the time.  Even though the weather is better for motorcycle riding for most of the year than much of the U.S., my city's fog and breeziness means dust and grime can accumulate pretty quick.  And I'd rather have the UV in sunlight tearing wearing down a cover than the much more expensive vinyl seat and paint job.\n\nI selected this Nelson-Rigg XL All-Season cover when it came time to replace my previous cover, which was finally tearing after seven or eight years.\n\nTwo things I learned that might inform others making a similar purchase.  The first point might be of interest to any buyer; the second only to those riding BMW airheads, which have a particularly long wheelbase.\n\nFirst, the cover I was previously replacing a Dowco cover (something like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/this/dp/B0022UP8XA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">this</a>), which is a substantially thicker material.  The Dowco being replaced was probably a bit bigger than the Nelson-Rigg (the equivalent of an XXL), and weighed 2.98lbs, whereas the Nelson-Rigg weighs 1.76lbs.  The thinner fabric will almost certainly mean a shorter lifetime, so the fact that this is a cheaper product might still not make it such a bargain.  So if you're using this cover where it will still be somewhat protected -- under a carport, for example -- then this might not matter, but if the cover is bearing the brunt of sun and storm, the heavier Dowco might be a better choice.  Note that otherwise, the two designs are almost identical; the Dowco has more room above the tail (for tail cases or sissy bars, for example), while the Nelson-Rigg has a second pair of grommets on the skirt, along with attached bungee cords, for securing the cover.\n\nSecond, the XL is big enough to fit a BMW R100RT -- barely.  My bike is a 1988 vintage, but all the late airhead RTs should be about the same size.  The primary thing that makes this a tight fit is the windscreen, which is tall enough to keep the skirt of the cover farther up the wheels than I would have preferred.  My bike does *not* have a tail case, which would definitely push the requirement into the XXL size.  In addition, many old airheads will have the original windscreen replaced by now, so if a shorter windscreen has been installed, the XL might be perfectly adequate.  If in doubt, anyone covering a BMW with a windscreen should probably err on the side of caution and get the XXL.\n\nUpdate: Gonna use this on the street in a city?  Get some stencils and spray paint and figure out how to mark it as yours.  Someone apparently decided last night that their motorcycle needed my cover more than mine did.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "01 19, 2013", "summary": "Good design; material a bit thin", "unixReviewTime": 1358553600}

What arrived at my doorstop was an unboxing experience! A tight-fit box lifts up to reveal a lovely cover photo, followed by a detailed manual, and finally the well-packaged bulbs which are exactly as pictured. For this price, I expected a plastic baggie, but that honor was reserved for the included hex key and silica packet.\n\nDesign is (supposedly) efficient enough that it doesn't require a noisy fan. Body is all-aluminum, in-line connector is waterproof and all wires are in one cable. The aforementioned connector has arrows indicating the correct way to fit the plug.\n\nWhile I can't say whether these are truly LUMILED, the LED placement matches the original halogen filament well, as pictured. Installation was easy and, when lit, the output is a bright white which just looks great. LEDs shipped already oriented to correctly face left-to-right when installed in housing. Initially I am thoroughly impressed, but only time will tell if this opinion stands.\n\nCons include the one of the set screws for the chuck getting stripped. No set screws for heat sink included like in the manual, but powdered sealant on the threads seems to be the maker's replacement. OEM connector blades had to be pinched slightly to fit the car, but that's simple enough.\n\nMost disappointing is the warranty. Manual claims 12-months but there is no manufacturer information inside or on the box. This is probably so companies can brand this as their own at a markup and provide their own warranty, such as Rigidhorse for $69.99. With perhaps the best design on the market, it'd be nice to have the manufacturer stand behind their excellent product.

Last week I happened to be looking at the scangaue and I happeend to see it for sale on Amazon so I figured ok lets give it a try.\n\nI received it today, unpacked it and rushed out to hook it up to the car.\n\nFirst and most striking part was how similar it was to the scangauge from look of the display to the placement and the font of the words.\n\nThen it took me nearly seconds to set it up and see what it was capable of.  Now people have complained about innacuracy but this is not the case with this unit.  The one I received is V1.1 and it is exact with the readings on my odometer when it comes to miles or distance traveled.\n\nSecond important feature was the fact that the unit can check vital systems in my car (2001 Cadillac Catera) and report wtih OK, NC or NA... I believe they call it readiness test.  I noticed also that it was also able to read my VIN Number.\n\nThirdly the unit seems to have features that lack on the scangauge.  For example when you are in GAUGE Mode, with the press of the side buttons you can switch between 3 or 4 pages and each one can be customized with whatever gauges you want to view.\n\nSo for me at start up I care about engine temp, open/closed loops, ignition, RPMs and intake air temp.  Then once moving I can swap to the next page which shows Speed, Average Fuel Consumption, DTE etc.\n\nFurther more there are many other options under trip and settings that appear to be easy to use and well though out form user stand point.\n\nSo my first impressions of the unit is that its cheaper then my ScanGauge, its better in many ways, and appears to function as designed.\n\nFurther testing and comparisons will be performed and another review will be posted.", "summary": "MaxiTrip beats ScanGauge in my book.", "unixReviewTime": 1256947200}

I used a larger than stock oil filter (mobil 1 extended) so we will just say it takes 4.5 quarts. after a couple weeks i noticed that the oil was below the bottom dot on the dipstick so i kept adding little sips of oil and then rechecking the level. i eventually i had to add the remainder of the of the jug so within the 1-1.5k initial miles after the change, a top off was needed. about 4k miles after the initial change, another top off was needed. it took almost a whole other quart. a little math here: .5 quarts at the first top off and ill just estimate .7 of a quart at the second top off. at 5k since initial oil change, i am still within the required oil level range on the dipstick. so thats over a quart of burned oil in around 5k miles. my car says about 40% oil life is left.

They are very sturdy. I own a 2012 Tacoma Double Cab, and bear in mind that when you receive these, the packaging and instructions will indicate they are for 05-11 Tacomas.

I asked them if I was sent the incorrect version and bracket for my 12 Tacoma, they assured me that the brackets do fit the front of 2012 and newer, only 1 screw is used even though there are two on my trucks. I installed them with the help of a friend, and they fit well enough, just not perfect. I wish they included a bracket for newer Tacomas. I also purchased the Step Pads for these as well, separately though. (should be included IMO) They look great but the screws included are ridiculously poor quality, and not long enough to secure the actual pads.
