I don't know if the stitching would continue to pull out if it was used as it is since the belt goes across it and presses against it, but the quality sure suffers with such poor stitching.  The rest of the holster appears to be stitched okay.  Apparently, a Quality Control issue.  Someone is not checking the sewing process closely.\n\nI bought this for a S&W Model 659 9mm.  There is no way the gun will fit into this holster without destroying the holster.  I can get the barrel in up to just past the trigger guard and it will go no farther.  I also tried my Glock 29 (Glock calls it a subcompact) and it would not fit either.  The body of the Glock is wider than the S&W and I could not even get the trigger guard started into the holster.  How anyone determined this holster was suitable for a large frame semi-auto is beyond me.  Both of these pistols have large, square trigger guards.  Now I am going to have to be out postage to return this improperly advertised and defective piece of merchandise to Holster World.\n\nThe distance across the holster at the top is about 4 3/4 inches.  Inside the stitching it is 3 7/8 inches.  At the bottom it is about 3 7/8 inches.  Inside the stitching it is 3 1/4 inches.  The height is 2 7/8 inches.  This is not suitable for a large frame pistol.\n\n8/13/2014  Addendum:  Decided that I did not want to be out money to send this holster back, so bought a subcompact that I had been wanting, a Kahr CM9.  This gun fits this holster quite well.  The leather on this holster is fairly thick and so adds a bit of bulk.  Again, I do not see how this holster is meant for larger weapons.  The CM9 fits pretty good, but any gun larger than it would cause problems as far as I can tell.", "summary": "Holster not suitable for large frame semi-autos and it has defective stitching.

Yes, A file. Files don't take whole hours for 5 inch Blades. finally i got it decently about as sharp as a kitchen knife.  the blade was so dull at first that i had to apply pressure with the file, and my hand slipped, and right now i got a deep cut on my finger. the knife suprised me that it could cut me cuz i had honed it for an hour before it cut me.when i first pushed straight on the blade before sharpening, nothing happend. still noticing how wobbly the blade was i set about to tightening the bolt to see if that was the problem. i applied the socket wrench with the extender arm and gave one good turn and the blade was secure and not wobbly. finally, i thought the knife was usable, after i sat on the computer for hours choosing the perfect knife, and i thought i had one. one more turn and the damn thing Broke. totally unfixable. so after 20.99, Twenty dollars i could have bought a good knife with, but listend to these false reviews about how lovely it was, so i bought it and payed dearly. as of now i am using the Broken blade for a spear. just to make use of the loss. i kept the compass, which does work. and the fishing line. hopefully no other people out there goes through what i did.

Your hand continues to pull the gauge to the rear AFTER the trigger breaks so the digital readout is the final force of your pull against the final rear-most position of the trigger.  This problem is most pronounced with a trigger that has over-travel.  To get the best accuracy you have to steady your hand against the stock attempting to minimize this contamination, but still the final readout is an overstated approximation.

Some company should reissue old-style WINGNUTS that do the same job, have no moving parts, cost about $2-3 each, and are simply a replacement for each axle nut. This problem was solved in 1920 and forgotten with QR hubs for racing.\n\nOriginal review: These look like the perfect product, but they are HEAVY. Considering that they replace the need to carry a wrench, they are nice. But.. a small wrench weighs almost nothing. These feel like 10 lbs in the package- very disappointing. I put them on my Shimano Nexus 8 speed bike (rear)- but it is such a pain to change a flat- one still needs several tools for that- these release devices seem pointless now. With a 1 or 3 speed these might be a perfect fit. As for my Nexus 8 speed-DON'T. Get a quality 3 speed- you will be happier if you have a flat.", "summary": "I have mixed feelings-why not use wingnuts?- lowered my rating!", "unixReviewTime": 1372032000}

Squatting in public is just not an option anymore. Here are my needs: Discretion is key, comfort, usability and performance are also top priorities. I ordered \"Go Girl\", \"Shewee\", \"Wiz Freedom\" & pStyle. I tried them all right out of the box, without a shower trial. Initially I used my own home bathroom, standing over the toilet with my pants only as far down as discretion would allow. I also tried them with jeans, bicycle shorts and yoga pants. Here are my results:\n\nShewee- When I used this product I had urine on my clothing. I tried using it 3 times with the same results. Its very bulky and therefore not discrete, The clear tube must be used because the green funnel isn't long enough to exit the urine safely away from the body. It is made of hard plastic, so it will not collapse during use but still needs 2 hands because its so long and narrow you need to hold both ends. It comes with its own caring case, which is a plus. The part of the funnel you hold next to your body is extremely narrow, the funnel itself is so narrow if one was to release a large volume, quickly, I think it would overflow. You also need to wipe afterward because if you try to wipe yourself with it, its just to narrow, plus now you have 2 plastic pieces that are also wet (besides yourself and your clothing). This devise is generally hard to use, indiscrete (dark greenreally?) and bulky both to carry and use. I would give the Shewee a rating of 1 star. I expected more from REI.\n\nWiz Freedom- Out of the package, first try worked fine. Its flexible and therefore needs both hands to keep it in place and prevent crimping. This devise was not very discrete, anyone seeing you from the side would wonder about this long bright pinkish-purple thing sticking out from between your legs. It doesnt come with a carrying case and I couldn't figure out how on earth I would carry this discreetly in my purse or use it in an emergency. It also  stays wet and theres the issue of self-clean-up, since you are wet after use. At least it doesnt wet your clothing so, I would give this 2 stars.\n\nGo Girl- no leaking on first try, more difficult with elastic clothing due to the flexibility of the product, good discretion, you do need to use both hands to hold it tight to your body and keep it from crimping. I liked that it folded in half- and I could fit it into a small iPhone case on my waist when not in use! I didn't like that there was still moisture in the devise and on my body when I finished, and therefore needed to wipe myself and figure out what to do with the paper. I would give this product 3 stars.\n\npStyle- Worked great out of the package. Just the right length, the color option of semi-clear lavender makes it discrete as well. Because this devise is made of semi-flexible smooth plastic with rounded edges you can effectively use it to wipe yourself, when you are done. By gently pressing up and away from yourself, you are virtually dry- the last few drops go out the end. If you shake it, the pStle is virtually dry. as well If you want to really get it clean, just use a little water from your water bottle to shoot down the spout. If you buy the caring case you can pop the pStyle in there quickly and easily,  and carry on without any fuss. The case just looks like an eyeglasses case and is totally washable with a Velcro closure. The case also comes in a blue-jean material, it can be hung on a belt loop or on the outside of a bag, purse or backpack with its mini carabiner. Because it is semi-ridged it requires only 1 hand in the middle to hold it in place it won't collapse. It also will not overfill or back-up because it is not a funnel, its more of a half-pipe. This is the only one I use now. I would give the pStle 5 stars, with a BIG thank you to the people who designed and distributed this product.", "summary": "I Tried 'Em All- Not Recommened", "unixReviewTime": 1433980800}

It looks great, is easy to open, close, and clean, has an on/off valve, and even has a covered hose! When I started using it though I found several flaws.\n\nThe hose is pretty nice. It is easy to scew in and doesn't leak. The on/off valve works well, the bite guard performs admirably, and having a cover is also very convenient. The only real complaint I have is that with the valve and guard/cover it is pretty difficult to get through the hole in the back of packs and through the sleeves down the shoulder straps. Once in place though it is fine.\n\nBeing 3L this thing holds a lot of water, which is great. However, I found I could only fill this to about 2L because the main screw on lid leaks. When filled up all the way the lid continuously drips. I examined the gasket and the lid and they both seem fine, so it has to be with how it attaches. The idea of a quarter turn lid is great, but in practice it fails to deliver. I'd take a full screw on lid any day if it means no leaks. I was very unhappy to find that after the hour and a half car ride to the trail head that my pack was wet and my sleeping bag damp. It made for a very uncomfortable first night.\n\nOverall, if you only fill this up to 2L the bladder works well. There are however 2L bladders for cheaper than this, and if I'd wanted to carry 2L I would have purchased one of those. I'll probably be looking for a new bladder soon. This one aimed for above its price range and succeeded in several ways but failed in the most basic sense.\n\nEDIT: I've now taken this out twice, for a total of 3 days on the trail.  It now leaks from the bottom as well as the top. Stopping for the night and finding out your sleeping bag is soaking wet is the worst thing ever. Cannot recommend this product at all.

It does not make a good seal and I lose a few LBs of pressure each time a reading is taken.  I wanted to carry it my bike pack for quick readings before taking a ride, it is useless for that.  Even if it worked, it is very \"heavy\" to carry with you on your bike (in the sense that you would prefer something very light) the heaviness really means solid construction and I think it is well made for shop use, possibly for schrader valves as others suggested.  So I strongly cannot recommend this product for Presta valves.  It is a shame, a simple design change would make this a great tool.\n\nUPDATE TWO WEEKS LATER:\nI setup an Amazon return and was ready to send the item back to Amazon.  Before sending it back I went to the Bike Planet because I kept saying to myself, how can this item that appears to be well made simply not work.  Checking the Bike Planet website it actually has a note for this product which says \"This Product will not work with removable valve core stems\" ...... Oh .... so that explains it .... but wait a minute  ... removable valve stems are so common .....\n\nThinking about it more, now I started to get mad .... \"They clearly say on their website that this will not work with some presta valves so now they need to update the Amazon site to avoid customer frustration.  So now ready to \"give them a piece of my mind\" I wait until Monday morning and call Bike Planet.  I speak to a young lady in customer service and tell her what happened .... she says \"Oh, we made a design change and we have a new adapter which will work with all Presta Valves, I will send it to you in the mail\"  WHAT did you say??\n\nSo three days later, I receive the newly designed nose piece and it works great.  Luckily I called Bike Planet because I ended up with a really nice gauge.  Problem solved.\n\nSo here is what you need to know.\n\n1.  The item as shown in the photo has a really short nose piece and will not work with Presta valves with a removable core.\n2.  As of August 2016, Bike Planet made a design change and the item DOES work for Presta Valves with removable cores.\n2.  Bike Planet does not advertise that yet on their website (8/14/2016).  They actually say it won't work.\n3.  Which version will you get from the various sellers on Amazon... who knows?  Ask the seller before you buy.\n4.  Worst case, if you get the wrong nose from your amazon seller, Bike Planet will send you the correct piece\n\nI hope this helps", "summary": "IF YOU ONLY READ ONE REVIEW ...

I think its weird as some of the spots or on the top of the sleeve, not a place perspiration would normally be a problem (if thats what the problem is). I'm afraid this pink shirt I purchased will ultimately completely fade and I'll have to throw it out.  I'm so dissapointed :(  I'm changing my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars.  I would even reduce it more, but I purchased several of these shirts and none of the others have faded at all.  I own the white, beige, orange, blue and the pink one.

However, I didn't like the placement of the bottles as the front bottles interferred with my arm swing (on the 4-bottle belt). Even if you remove the front two bottles, the cup holster still got in my way. With the 2-bottle belt, it rode comfortably on my backside, but I couldn't reach the pouch to grab jelly bellies and goo on the run. With the bottles in front, I ran into the problem of my arms swinging into the bottles again.\n\nThe Fuel Belt was comfy, but not as comfy as the Nathan. Had the same problem as the Nathan in terms of arms hitting the bottles and not being able to access the pouch when it's situated on my back. Additional disadvantage of the Fuel Belt is that it takes two hands to place the bottles back in the holster. Also, I seem to fall between sizes where the small was too small and the medium too large.\n\nI ended up purchasing the Amphipod b/c of its flexibility. I'm 5'3\", 110 lb.  Although it took a few tries to figure out how to configure the belt, I finally got it so that the bottles would stay out of the way and I could still reach the pouch to grab my jelly bellies on the run. I wish I could run with the belt on my hips, but it's much more comfortable on my waist. With it on my hips, even though I tightened it completely, it had a tendency of riding up b/c of the movement of my legs or when removing the bottles. Additionally, you could feel the weight of the bottles bouncing more with the belt around my hips (especially in the rear!). Around my waist, the rear bottles sat comfortably on the small of my back (sideways to minimize sloshing). I found that the belt stayed in place as long as I wore it just tight enough to wrap comfortably around my waist. It didn't move much b/c it naturally sat in the curve of my waist (and I don't have curves!), so I didn't feel constricted at all. It takes a little getting used to, but it's not uncomfortable at all.\n\nSome people mentioned that it was hard to snap the bottles in and out.  I found this to be extremely convenient since you can access the bottles with just one hand, allowing your other arm to maintain its swing. It takes a little practice to get the feel for it, but it was very easy to remove and replace the bottles in the holster. If you're unsure, just jiggle the bottle slightly to make sure it's locked in place. Again, you can do this all with one hand, unlike with the Fuel Belt.  Overall I'm happy with my purchase. I wish the belt part was as comfortable as the Nathan belt, but I need the adjustability factor due to my petite frame.

As many reviewers have stated, the light is amazingly bright for such a small, inexpensive unit. Bell really got that part right. However, the physical construction is extremely poor.\n\nThe release tabs on both units quickly broke. One the first one, I accidentally knocked the light against a pole while locking up and it snapped the tab off. However, there was enough of the catch mechanism left on on the housing that I was able to continue using the light by holding it in place with a strong rubber band. The release tab lasted about 4 months. On the second unit, the housing was so loose that the light just slid off every single time I picked up my bike with the front lower angled downward. Seriously, it was like a wet kid going down a water slide. No resistance whatsoever. As I wiggled the release tab to see if it would catch on to the light unit, it snapped off in my hand like a pretzel. This happened on the first day of use.\n\nThere was another major flaw that common to both units I received: Every time I went over a bump in the road, the light would switch off. Trying to replicate the problem, I held the light in the palm of my hand and firmly tapped it with my other hand. Both lights would switch off every time I did this. Pretty terrible, definitely not what you want while riding around NYC.\n\nIn my opinion, the Dawn Patrol headlight is perfect for a quick evening ride around the cul de sac. For anyone thinking to use this for long commutes on varied urban terrain, or for off-road riding, I would strongly recommend against getting this light.

The problem is that they are cords, after all. When you pull on it there is only resistance at the end of the motion. If you decide to use a heavier cord for whichever exercise you're doing, then you won't be able to pull it far enough. Basically, it's a lose-lose situation. Too light = pull too easily but can go all the way with the effort in the end. Too heavy = you can pull at the beginning but not really at the end. This makes for a \"half\" pull on every pull, if you know what I mean.\n\nThen when this dawns on you, you realized you just spent $130 on a bunch of rubber tubes and straps. I admit that I mostly bought them so I can do a tricep pull down, because I really loved the machine in the gym. Don't bother. There is that \"half-pull\" problem and on top of that it feels nothing like the one in the gym. Also, with cords, it feels like most of the effort is used just to balance the cord as you move it and the exercise itself isn't even about your muscle anymore.\n\nAlso, I should have trusted my instincts. In their training vids, they have the cords attached to a steel door. I don't know about you but my normal door, which isn't weak, is already starting to seem like it will degrade if I continue to use my cords on it (even if I use the hinge side). It's definitely not going to fly long term. I also read other reviews in the lower priced packages where people wrote that the smaller cords (including the red one) have snapped while they used it. So as I use the cords, that fact is always looming over my head. It's rubber, it will weaken over time, no matter what. I purposely wear my glasses when I use them so it doesn't take out my eye. This also shows that the product will definitely not last (bodylastics does have a solution to this though, apparently after 2 months after purchasing you can still replace cords for a lower price). But to me, it's just not worth the trouble.\n\nI gave this product 2 stars because it is exactly what it is - so it deserves 1 star above the lowest possible rating. You get what you get in the picture. But I gotta say, don't be fooled by their videos with the trainers/actors using it and really \"selling\" it. In reality it's just nowhere near as fantastic at all and I am 100% certain that those trainers do not use them on a regular day. And again, it's $130 for rubber tubes and velcro straps. Even though they're the best rubber tubes on the market... they're still rubber tubes. Again, there is nothing wrong (so far) with the product. This is just my personal opinion.\n\nI am by no means a disgruntled customer and I am not going to return the product because I believe it was exactly what I bought (there are no defects). But do take my review as a warning. Right now, my bag is sitting by itself, unused. I may give it a few more tries for the novelty fun of it, and to make the best of the $130 I spent, but mark my words, it will eventually go down in time as \"junk.\"", "summary": "Not worth it...", "unixReviewTime": 1282953600}

I had to pour out 100 pounds of molded rotting feed.\n First you either need really long arms or extra long tools to put this thing together. It is a two person job if you don't have really long arms and tools for sure. The design could be better with an internal bracket that actually seals the feeder legs. This would also make installing the legs easy rather than trying to hold each, both at arms length with a ratchet drive or wrench while reaching over with the other hand and trying to tread a washer and nut.\n I sealed the feeder legs with flex seal because no matter how tight you got the bracket and nuts, you can still see light peering through which means moisture can get in. Why they didn't design this with some sort of weather seal is beyond me as that is typically the number 1 issue causing gravity feeders getting clogged. The last thing is the hollow legs... why not sealed legs so the dirt/mud does not get in them causing rust, or adding a pedal on the ends?\n If you want this expensive feeder, don't buy it.

I have owned it and used it regularly for 5 months. There is 1 huge problem with it though. It's braking! (Or lack thereof) With its single wheel drive system, when the controller brake is activated to slow down, it bites very hard and only to the one rear wheel. At high speeds, it becomes very noticeable and dangerous. Especially downhill. When you need to slow down, even slightly pressing down on the brake will cause the rear end and board to get very squirly and wobbly. It is unpredictable as well.\nI had not fallen until this last week. While riding downhill, I slightly began pressing down on the controller brake. The board twisted and began to wobble and went sideways. I tried to run off of it but went down. I broke my left arm at the elbow in the process.\nUntil they can make it brake safely (possibly with 2 wheel drive and braking) the board is dangerous. In my opinion, it should be recalled until a safe solution is found.\nIt speeds along well at 12mph flat ground but still the braking is an issue on even flat surfaces.

My current favorite has lasted longer than most, my STM messenger bag.  It has plenty of individual small storage spots for things like USB sticks, portable hard drives, external CD drives, portable chargers, cables, etc...  For me that's the most critical thing in a laptop carrying bag of any type.  If all I want is a way to carry the laptop by itself with nothing more than a power cable, I can do that with a cheap, small padded sleeve.  If I want a bag where I have to throw everything into a single compartment then dig through it trying to find something every time I need it, I can buy just about any backpack that has a padded sleeve.  Finding something that's useful to me or my clients is tough.\n\nThis one isn't the worst thing I ever have seen, but it's far from even middle of the road when compared to all the others I've tried.  The whole \"TSA friendly\" concept that you can just unfold it but leave it in the bag is something I've never hit.  Milwaukee, Chicago, Atlanta, none of the other bags I've had have ever actually allowed this to happen.  I've *ALWAYS* been told to pull the laptop out of the case and put it in a separate tray.\n\nThere is only one compartment that has any small storage slots - and none of them have any kind of top to fold down to hold things in them.  There's only 3 sleeves in one of the compartments that are rather small and narrow, wouldn't fit any but one of my external drives (the small laptop type, not the larger 3.5\" standard internal hard drive size).\n\nSo that leaves two full sized compartments for everything to just be shoved to mingle, leaving you to have to dig and find what you want, although they work well for clothes and such.  But again, I'm looking for a laptop bag, not a suitcase.  I have several suitcases for clothes, my laptop bag I just want something I can carry the things I need for my laptop, not a change of clothes.\n\nThen there's the laptop sleeve itself, on the inside surface of the backpack right against the wearer's back. It's padded, but still a bit awkward with the solid rectangle of a laptop inside there.  And there's not any padding on the bottom where the laptop edge would be resting on the floor.  There's the folded over seam that forms the edge of the slot the laptop goes into, but it's not very protective.  I'd hate to be setting it down and misjudge slightly how close to the ground I was when I set it down, since it just doesn't feel very safe down there.\n\nIt can be awkward getting the laptop in and out as well, since this is under the straps.  They block the lower part of the opening.\n\nIt's well constructed though, the seams and stitching is top notch.  And I really do like the color.  But the small loop on top for carrying is just a web strap, no softness or padding for the times you're lugging it by that instead of over your shoulder.\n\nAll told, this just isn't something I'd carry my laptops around in.  I'll stick with my Pelican and STM bags.", "summary": "More negatives than positives for my use", "unixReviewTime": 1406246400}

It was shipped and received within a few days, and we took it with us this past weekend, looking for sea trout, grouper and king mackerel in Tampa Bay.  Our first fish was a three pound mackerel so we whipped out the ARC to quickly release him.  Just like the hundreds and hundreds off times before with our previous ARC, I grabbed the leader in one hand and slid the de-hooker down to the hook and pulled tight to release the fish.  At that moment, the rod of the de-hooker snapped off at the handle and went flying into the sea.  Left with only the handle and one mad mackerel, which were both eventually lost overboard during the ensuing fire drill, we couldn't believe what had just happened.  I didn't even have anything to return for a replacement.\n\nI've just now ordered my third one, and if it lasts as long as my first one, I'll come back and change the rating.

I'm pretty easy to please, but I cannot get over this product.\n\nLike many who will be buying this tomahawk, I was spurred by Wranglerstar's review of it. He got it for $24, but once the video posted the demand pushed the price up to $38. I went for it anyway, due to the well made look that Cody's had. I knew that the edge would be non-existent and the haft would need a good fitting. What Cody's specimen didn't have was what caused me to take off 3 stars.\n\nThe Handle:\nLet me start with the good part. I liked the handle. The grain ran at a 45 degree angle to the bit and was finished in a light wax. It does have a bit of heartwood in it, but I don't mind. The fit was good to the top if the eye, but had gaps at the bottom. This is not an uncommon problem on budget hawks. I generally ensure that the head doesn't move during use and not worry too much about it looking perfect.\n\nThe Head:\nSo mine came the same as Wranglerstar's, with about 1mm flat where the sides should meet to form an edge. I don;t think they intended to complete the edge, but just wanted to establish a bevel. Then things stared going south. The cheeks (sides) of the bit do have a nice rough finish and scale from forging and heat treating, but the top and bottom look like they were ground in the dark. The angle of the grind changes and multiple passes the don't line up. It looks like it was done by angle grinder and is similar to how metal looked when I first used the tool. I thought about trying to grind it flat myself, but considering I paid almost $40, I wanted something better than Cold Steel. This unfortunately is not it. The heads on the Cold Steels, while slathered in paint, are better finished.\n\nOverall, if this were to cost $24, I might get one. Might.

Sullivan", "reviewText": "I really like the Basis health tracker. It is the most comfortable monitor that I've worn so far. The band is large enough to accommodate my wrist with four holes left over if I wear it comfortably snug, and three holes remain if I wear it loosely; I'm a six foot two man, who weighs about two-fifty.\n\nThe technology behind this monitor is fairly impressive. In typical use, this makes a fantastic watch. The time is displayed by default, while a touch of the lower left control dot will toggle to a display of the date in day name, calendar date and month format. The readout consists of unlit digits on a black background - it would be nice to have an option to display the inverse, although I am happy with it as it is. The top left dot temporarily enables the backlight. If lifting the watch up to look at the face of the watch, the backlight automatically comes on, which makes for convenient low light viewing.\n\nMonitor functions are simple. There are top and bottom touch control dots on the right hand side of the watch, which cycle through calories burned, heart rate, steps taken. I haven't ridden my bike, but it interpreted my lawn mowing session as a bike ride, which will also be one of the cycle-through options if there is any time registered for the day. It may be that when motion is tracked without a swinging arm that it assumes bicycling. At least it registers the activity.\n\nThe numbers I get seem accurate overall, though early on I would occasionally read an astonishingly high or low heart rate, I'm not sure if this is because I was wearing it loosely, or if it was not in reading mode at the time - the heart symbol would be solid, whereas it displays a heart outline when normal readings show, but the compiled numbers appear to be acceptably correct.\n\nThe Basis Heath Tracker includes detailed information statistics when uploaded to my personal Basis account online. There, I can also view my sleep statistics. It has given proper details for the most part, but I have caught an instance where I was sitting and watching TV in the early morning that was reported as sleep. Between light sleep, heavy sleep and REM sleep, I am unsure how anything at the top of my wrist can indicate these things, but it tends to look believable, and my bed times and wake up times match up for the most part, so it does well at keeping track.\n\nThe watch itself is somewhat deep. It is quite compact for all of the features it entails, yet after several weeks of use, I have cut back on wearing it to bed. It's cool to track my sleep, but I like to conk out with an arm under my pillow as I lie sideways, and I get the princess and the pea effect with this hard metal square under my pillow. Sure, I get used to it or adjust until I drift off, but in the grand scheme of things, I know when I sleep, so as cool as it seems, I really don't need to look at it again on the computer.\n\nIn the early days of wearing my monitor, there was a recall on a competing product due to a rash. I wondered if it was a thing with monitors, because I was developing a rash on my wrist with this product. Being inquisitive as to cause, I realized that it may be that when I wash my face at night, and get that little bit of soap and water under the band and go to sleep on it, that it may have been the cause, and it was. I began the habit of removing the band when washing up and putting it back on dry before bed, and it went away. This is not something of which to be alarmed; when I was a dishwasher years ago, the same thing happened with my wrists after prolonged exposure to the stainless steel washer and constant contact with my wrists with hot soapy water - not sure why, but it was a thing. I was provided the 2014 Carbon Steel Edition of the Basis Health tracker, and it has the metal mounts for the band. I like the 2014 band for its low profile and sleek look.\n\nThe button on the side of the watch along the right is used to Enable Bluetooth when disabled, or it is used to Sync the Basis Monitor when Bluetooth is enabled, of by cycling to the next option with the touch dots along the right side of the face of the watch, I can disable Bluetooth when not in use. I like that I can upload my data through my iPhone via Bluetooth as a convenience option.\n\nThe Basis Health Tracker includes a charge cable, which can be placed over the face of the watch while worn at the computer. When I remove my watch from my wrist, a small green flicker on the underside of the monitor appears to be disconnecting from the Borg collective. It's kind of cool.\n\nOverall, I like the Basis. I almost love it. The statistics are applied to habits, which one unlocks with points under the website account. The habits that encourage me, are the same habits which discourage me once I miss enough of them within a week to accomplish them. It still provides an easy way to tell where I'm faltering in my activity. If I achieve a habit in one week, it increases the multiplier for that habit the next week. It's like a fun, points-accumulating game in that regard. When the multiplier goes up, so does the number of successful days required to achieve that particular habit.\n\nThe Basis 2014 Edition is a wonderful health monitor, and an even cooler watch. It looks great, it is quite comfortable, and the depth of the face is the only thing that may ever get in the way of anything, but still, it's fairly compact. I like that it is a highly functional, wrist-only solution. I've tried the Omron strap and band combo, and I've tried a pay-to-play arm band endorsed by a weight loss show. I still love my Omron, but its wristwatch is ridiculously uncomfortable, and I stopped using my pay-to-play as soon as my free subscription ran out - mainly I couldn't stand the chore of the manual nutrition entry. The Basis, is by far, even still an enjoyable unit, even after I've given up on caring about sleep patterns. It holds about a four day charge, though I've gone longer. It's still fun to use, I enjoy the convenience of checking on my daily progress, and it is an absolutely stylish and gorgeous watch with cool features and controls.\n\n=======\nUPDATE:\n\n09-29-14 (about six months later)\n\nI may as well hurry up and update to compare longevity, in that within the last month I have been having issues with the watch, of which the only abuse it may have received is whacking against a counter corner while I walk through the house. Anyway, the problems are that I have had to hard reset the Basis whenever my silver dots become non-responsive - I took a guess and held down the side button, to which after several seconds it would flash off, and then work properly afterward...for a while...perhaps as little as five minutes sometimes, or long stretches, it varies.\n\nI wore this watch day in and day out. I tried to keep it up on charges, but had difficulty keeping up with it, whether every four days got tedious, or if it wasn't quite going four days anymore, which is what I suspect. The last time I wore it, I got an out of memory error.\n\nI just saw this has been discontinued by the manufacturer, so I'll just leave it at that. It's still a wonderful watch, lighting up when flipped, and all, but yeah...its pretty much done.", "summary": "I (Used To) Almost Love It - My (Previous) Favorite Health Tracker So Far - (Updated)", "unixReviewTime": 1396483200}

Was checking my past reviews and saw that the description of these gloves now leaves out the Seirus brand name in the description which is a good thing! At least buyers will not be mislead in what they think they are buying. Like other reviews, after using them this past winter, I found that these gloves do not 'breathe' and your hands get sweaty in them and the zippers on mine became separated so I had to carefully re-align the zippers, leaving both gloves zipped up permanently so they don't come apart. It's a tight fit, but now I just slip them on.", "summary": "False advertising", "unixReviewTime": 1458691200}

We don't use it a lot, so I can't speak to how well it holds up to everyday use, or out in a survival type situation.  I can tell you though that it is quite fun throwing it at a wooden target in my backyard.  While this certainly isn't authentic in design or physical appearance to those used by Native Americans, and Frontiersmen in the Eastern Woodlands long ago, one still feels a connection to that heritage as you become more skilled at sticking it in the target and hitting what you aim at.  Its a lot of fun for adults, and for kids, providing they are supervised by the adults.  For being a backyard Daniel Boone, or a suburban Tecumseh, it certainly fills the bill.  It also has a \"cool\" modern look to it as well.  Haven't gotten good enough with it yet to whack squirrels or rabbits in the backyard, but I hope to reach that happy goal someday.  Here's a tip though: when you first start tossing this around, put the family dogs in the house.  The instinct to avoid falling prey to wildly flung battle-axes has apparently been bred out of the typical American canine over the intervening 260 years.

I don't care if the company is foreign-owned.  As long as they employ American workers here making their products (Toyota, Honda, Bridgestone, etc) I'll buy it over anything made elsewhere.  Especially the total crap that's made by our number one enemy in the World: China.  However, that's a whole other story for another time.  If you are going to make products that attract and interest American outdoorsmen, then it would behoove you to build a factory in one of the fifty states and hire you some American workers.

Self-massagers have been historically disappointing, but after a hard day, I'm always tempted to try yet another one to see if it will actually help out with back and shoulder aches.\nAfter having this for a week or so, I think I have more complaints about it than accolade. First, the product description seems to imply that you can use this product on your own. I tried, and I found that solo operation is both ridiculous looking and feeling. Because of the length of the item, I found that I cannot get it to roll down my back at any comfortable angle. I think this would only be possible were one a contortionist and able to dislocate one or both shoulders. I also found that, solo, I cannot apply the pressure I need.\n\nAnother complaint has to do with the \"customizability\" of the product: it's just... not, really. While you can certainly remove some or even most of the rings, there is nothing on the rod that will set the place of the remaining rings, causing them to move around haphazardly while the product is in use. There *is* a small bit of friction, but there is not a \"ring lock\" or anything like that.\n\nYet another complaint involves the structure of the ring-holding rod: it's basically plastic, and not even particularly hard plastic. You can bend this thing pretty easily. Imagine trying to roll a lump of dough with a 2-foot section of steel cable or thin PVC pipe: it flattens the very top of the dough, but then bows out in the middle and compresses on the ends, still leaving a rounded section in the middle of the dough lump. The malleability of the rod essentially makes it impossible to apply the pressure I need to my back and shoulders -- I can't roll out the lumps in my muscles well enough, or evenly enough.\n\nAnother: the exercise guide that the product description says the item contains is actually downloadable content, not an actual book or leaflet: so, when you receive the item, there will be yet more to do. And if you're like me, you won't even download the guide, but rather just start using the product on its own.\n\nThe one positive is that the product, for what it is, actually feels relatively nice -- better than nothing at all, certainly -- IF you have someone else helping you out. But it's not a miracle massager by any means, as I hope this review has shown. Unless you're super sore, don't expect to melt into a puddle with the Gaiam.", "summary": "Another disappointing muscle massage product", "unixReviewTime": 1444953600}

To say the least I was ecstatic at my good fortune. I took it home and after 1.5 hours of struggling by myself to set this up I figured it out (first set up is a truly a pain if you don't have a partner helping you). I set it up and it looked glorious. We were expecting storms so I took down the tent and waited a week to set it up again in the yard. This time when setting up the tent, not one but both bay window poles splintered badly one stabbing me in the hand-I was very unhappy. I called and they are going to send me replacement parts hopefully those will be better. I think the tent is a good size for a family of 4; 2 queensize beds fit with room to spare for gear. I wouldn't dream of packing 8 people in this tent. The ventilation with windows open was very good (zero condensation).  I tend to think in lists so I'll run down good bad and otherwise.\n\nGood: Size-large but no so huge you would have a hard time fitting it on a site, Venting, lots of airflow is always good, Sturdy-aside from the window poles when this tent is set it feels substantial, Water repellancy-while every other tent says to spray them with repellant this one specifically says not to (except seams); Color I like the color palate for this tent -not gaudy but not boring\n\nBad: Snapping poles in bay windows hopefully this is addressed with higher quality replacements sent from manufacturer. Also my orange center poles show signs of stressing at joints. I know how to use shock corded poles so I'm not just partially inserting them. I bought a cheapy tent at Target years ago and have used it dozens of times with no pole damage. Room Divider-while most room dividers hang in place with toggles this one is sewn to the floor and sticks up about 4 inches HUGE tripping hazard.\n\nOther: Since I've recently tried 4 family tents I can tell you that this tent is missing several amenities that I liked in the Coleman Rockwall: Rigid door, self rolling windows and integrated lighting...Rockwall was HUGE and had some durability issues but those features were really really nice.\n\nOverall I'm not going to give this tent 4 stars because Northpole obviously has quality issues with their poles, customer service was aware of a quality issue (a bad batch -is what they said) and yet they shipped these with bad poles. Since most of the reviews have had poles snap on 1st or 2nd setup I don't think quality control was rigorous enough-now I'm going to be waiting 3 weeks for replacements from the manufacturer.\n\nUPDATE 1 ***I have received the replacement poles (About 10 days after calling)They appear to be more rigid than the first set and different colors (I'm actually kinda bumbed that the orange ones were replaced with olive colored ones). I will test them out soon and see if they break or deform like the first ones. Hopefully the hasslefree replacement parts will solve the problem and make this the family tent for the next 10 years. I'll update with results if these are crummy too.\n\nUPDATE 2 ***Went camping 3rd time in this tent and used the new replacement poles. The replacement window poles are definitely more rigid than the originals and a little longer. EXTREMELY difficult to thread into place and get both end caps in slot provided...I was very carefull because the originals broke so easily but these were really hard to get in. Kinda bummed that the zipper on the expandable gusset part of the bag broke off completely leaving the bag in the fully expanded position, this is not a huge deal but I was not ruffing the bag up at all and the zipper busted off. The new top poles replacing the orange ones felt about the same after first time up they show no signs of deformity. I really like the ventialation options in this tent (it was warm in the day so we opened it up and cool at night so we just left open the cyclonic vents) but I'm seeing the same quality here that I saw with Coleman; Greatland; Columbus; Northern Territory, and Alpine Design...Definately not worth the price as similar quality/size/amenities can be had for less.\n\nUPDATE 3 ***Went camping 3 more times in this. Had window poles snap again on me and had seam come apart at door zipper. Once again Columbia came through and replaced both tent skin, tent bag, and poles. From that perspective I'm extremely happy with the warranty. However I've heard they'll no longer honor warranty claims on my purchase (I haven't had any additional claims so I'm not 100% sure on that) My understanding is that this tent has been redesigned and is now much better than it was. During our only camping trip with rain we did experience leaks in both bay windows so I treated the seams all throughout the inside of the tent. Our next trip we did not have rain so I don't know if seam sealing will solve this problem or not. I think that there is no 'perfect tent'and really you just have to weigh the features that you find most valuable. I think my next camping purchase will be a popup camper and i'll be leaving the tent behind.

The arrows were carbon with some aluminum ones as well.  All arrow shafts needing fletching were properly prepared including a thorough scraping and following it up with denatured alcohol.  After attaching the fletching, an extra drop of glue was added to the front and rear of each fletch for strength.  All arrows were stored vertically and the glue was left to set for a good 24 hours before the arrows were allowed to be used.\n  By the time camp was over, we had about 5 arrows still in good condition.  I had fletching falling off before the arrows even hit the targets.  Others stripped off after hitting the targets.  In general, the glue seemed to hold on the arrow shafts about 80% of the time, but it stripped off of the plastic fletching.  In any case,I would not recommend this product in the future. 12/28/13 UPDATE:  I have been in contact with the manufacturer & they have sent new sample to try.

I'm a little disappointed.\n\nFirst, out of the box, the knife is very stiff and hard to open, even by hand. I added a drop of oil and tried to loosen the screw a little bit. After playing around with it for a few minutes, it started to loosen up. I had a hard time getting the knife to deploy with the Emerson wave feature out of my pocket before loosening it up. It's a nice feature, but with the knife as small and stiff as it is, I think speedsafe opening (like from the Leek or Blur) might fit most people better. The thumb disk is for one handed opening, but good luck with getting the knife open one handed before loosening it up. That is the initial problem I have with the knife, the main feature doesn't work very well out of the box. It will loosen eventually, but it was really tight. The thumb disk is a questionable inclusion as well, I don't know why Kershaw didn't just use a thumb stud. A disk normally provides some extra grip for the thumb when holding the knife, but the wave feature hook on the top of the knife completely blocks the disk. At least there is some jimping on the hook.\n\nThe blade comes razor sharp. My blade didn't look completely straight. I read some of the other questions and reviews and looked closely at the knife, and sure enough, it looks like the grind is uneven. The blade is sharp, even though the grind appears to be uneven. Visually, the knife looks fairly elegant, but there are some things I don't like, besides the uneven blade. The choice to only have one side of the handle is G-10 is a really strange one to me. The blade oxide finish on the other side isn't as grippy as my Leek. There is a pocket clip, but this knife doesn't sit very deep in the pocket and about 0.75\" seems to stick out of the pocket. My personal preference is for knives that sit deeper in the pocket (like many SOG knives tend to) but to each their own. Finally, it is made in China. I'm not the biggest fan of that.\n\nThis is a cool knife to add to a collection, especially if you don't have an Emerson wave style knife. It won't be going into my EDC rotation anytime soon. It looks elegant, but I wish they did better QC of it. For the price, definitely a good deal, but I don't think I will be buying the rest of the Kershaw/Emerson series if they are of the same quality. I would recommend a Kershaw Leek over this.", "summary": "Cool knife with some flaws", "unixReviewTime": 1424649600}

The Allen Wrenches were the only useable tools that came with the rower.\nThe first step, went easy enough, but when it came to using the screwdriver to put on the chain covers, the first of two screws stripped.  So, I went and found a screwdriver in the garage to try to remove the second-same thing.  I think they were painted on, because they did not budge.\nOkay, so like many exercise equipment manuals, the directions are worded in such a manner that they read like the writer's first language is not American English.  It was easier to figure things out by looking at the diagrams.\nBecause the chain covers are not necessary for operation, I was able to exercise on the rower for 5 minutes.\nI do work out every morning, so it takes a bit of work to get my heart rate into aerobic mode.  I used all three cables (out of three) and rowed as quickly as possible and my heart rate only moved up to 100.  (This is using my own personal HRM.  The machine does not come equipped with one.)\nOverall, I was disappointed with the quality, but it is a better machine, exercise wise, than my less expensive rower, so it gets 3 stars.\nI would recommend this rower for a beginning exerciser, but not for an intermediate or advanced person.", "summary": "For Beginning Exercisers", "unixReviewTime": 1439337600}

I ride year-round, logging 2500-300 miles annually, mainly through a 20 mile commute to work several times a week.  With no bike shop nearby, I turned to Amazon Prime to get my out of my \"tight bind.\"\n\nBOTTOM LINE: While the price point is excellent, and they seem reasonably well constructed, I had several issues that will prevent me from buying more or recommending them to others.  I still gave them two stars because the price and quality was good, and my issues mainly deal with fit.  I am a reasonably proportioned 5'10\" adult male that doesn't usually have fit issues; nevertheless, others may find the fit to be perfect for them.\n\nLet me go into specific detail for my rating:\n\nISSUE #1: BELL BOTTOMS?!  When the Amazon box arrived, I tried the tights on.  While the waist and thighs seemed a bit snug, it wasn't so bad as to warrant a larger size, and I figured a day of riding would form them to my specific physique.  However, when I suited up for an actual ride this morning, I was surprised at how loose the ankles were when I zipped them up.  The inside of the cuff has a gummy material designed to prevent the pant from riding up.  However, there was so much fabric that the pant didn't actually grab my ankle.  How this manifested on my ride was that during the downhill runs, I got a chilly draft on the lower six inches of my leg.  Since these are cool weather tights, not cold weather ones (it was 50 this morning), this is not a catastrophic flaw.  However, I thought it was an idiosyncrasy worth mentioning.\n\nISSUE #2: SKINNY KNEES.  As my ride progressed, I found the material bunching uncomfortably at the back of my knees.  While this provided merely a petty annoyance on my 20 mile ride, I imagine it could become more of an issue on a longer haul where chafing could result.\n\nISSUE #3: POOR CHAMOIS PLACEMENT.  This was the deal breaker for me.  I found the chamois padding to be way too forward in the tights.  As a result, when I rode, much of the padding was in front of my crotch rather than under my seat.  While this resulted in some nice insulation for the family jewels on the chilly morning ride, the downside was that my sitz bones, the actual pressure point of my seat, was at the extreme back edge of the padding.  Furthermore, the rest of my gluteus was completely unprotected.  So, while the rest of my backside doesn't serve as a pressure point, it is still in contact with my seat.  I could actually feel the rivets on the back of my Brooks saddle through the thin, unpadded material!  I noticed this misfit immediately and stopped to see if I had put the tights on backward.  I hadn't, but I tried hiking up the back of the pants while wearing the front droopy.  This helped for about 1/4 mile until the material returned to its natural position through my normal body movements.\n\nI may try wearing my normal bike shorts under these tights to address this issue, but I suspect that the double padding will result in too much of a \"diaper effect\" to be a viable solution.  Since these tights were inexpensive and I've already ridden in them, I probably won't return them.  However, I am sure they will find their way to the back of my riding apparel drawer only to come out in a pinch when everything else is in the laundry.\n\nUPDATE: Within 24 hours of posting the review above, I was contacted by the company apologizing for the issues I experienced with these tights, and offering to make things right.  While nothing has changed about the product, that response alone garnered another star in my rating; excellent customer service goes a REALLY long way in my book.  I will work with the company and amend my review even further pending the outcome of this interaction.", "summary": "Disappointed, but optimistic...", "unixReviewTime": 1508976000}

I really liked the color of the jacket, and the sleeves were a perfect length on me.  Also,  I was looking for something with a lot of pockets.  This has 6 total, all on the outside.  It would have been nice to have at least  one more inner security pocket on the inside.  I did like the two cargo pockets on the outside, plus two roomy chest pockets, though I would have preferred their zips on top instead of the sides so things won't fall out if you leave them unzipped.  I mostly put car keys in pockets like these, and I wouldn't want to loose them.  The side hand warmer pockets had a very small opening and were a bit too small for my hands when wearing mittens.  I also found the cut of the coat two snug along the bottom.  The snugness seemed like a good idea to keep the wind out, but it was too tight to comfortably sit down, and that cheap zipper didn't have a bottom pull that could open up the coat a couple of inches at the bottom when sitting.  By contrast, the hood on this thing was gigantic and came down over my eyes.  The hood has no way to adjust it smaller, and  is not removable.\n\nI'm disappointed to have to return this, since it almost meets my needs, and I haven't found anything better yet (since an old old coat of mine that had 8 pockets all in perfect places).

This was a pleasant change. We did a dry run in our backyard, and when we took it to the campground it took us about 10 minutes to set up from unzipping the bag to putting in the last stake. It's a great-looking tent (we actually had a complement on it from a stranger), very spacious, very well-ventilated. The room dividers are nice, but it would be good to have other spots to hang them from for a little more customization. Also, the instructions have you put the rain fly up after the tent is up, but as another reviewer stated that's easier said than done. We found that if we shortened one side of the tent, slid the rain fly on, and then re-extended the poles it works great. We haven had it in rain yet, but the seams on the rain fly are taped, whereas the Coleman's weren't. Overall, great tent, but we'll update the review once we've had it in wet weather.\n\nEdit 7/29/16: the tent actually does quite well in the weather. We've spent several nights in pretty solid rainfall with minimal leaking. The leaking has come near the doors and the seams along the sides, but it's really not too bad.\n\nOur issue has been with the durability. The second time we used it we noticed a hole on the floor and in the ceiling. Since then we've patched several holes. The holes seem to be at points where the joints are rubbing against the fabric in storage. We've been very careful handling it and storing, not sure what the issue is, but this simply has not proved as durable as other tents have for us.

I wanted to get a set because I am a bit obsessive about making myself visible during my commutes of up to ~45 minutes, often in the dark.  A friend described me as \"lit up like Times Square on New Years Eve\" ... and that was before I started using the Orfos lights.  The lights definitely make me even more visible.\nI mostly like the lights.  I'm tempted to give them 4 stars but they definitely have some issues so I settled on 3.  They are quite bright on High, so bright that when I hold one to turn it on or off I cannot stand to look directly at the light.  The manufacturer advises against using the High intensity at night, with good reason.  Even on Low they are brighter than many other lights.  The light from the Orfos lights is somewhat directional, they definitely seem brighter from the front (or rear for the red light) than from the side, but they are MUCH more visible from the side than any other bicycle light I have ever seen.\nI do not have the ability to measure light intensity but I made subjective comparisons of the Orfos lights to my Serfas Thunder Blast lights.  When viewed from directly in front of or directly behind the bike, the Orfos lights were more visible on Low than the Serfas lights on low. The Orfos lights on Medium were more visible than the Serfas lights on High.  The Serfas on High may have been slighty brighter than the Orfos on low, it was hard to be sure.  When viewed from the side, the Orfos lights on any setting are MUCH more visible than the Serfas lights on High.\nThe lights attach to the bike magnetically.  They come with extremely strong rare earth magnets that can be attached to the bike using zip ties.  When mounted vertically, as recommended by the manufacturer, the lights are held quite securely.  It is hard to imagine that a properly mounted light would come off the magnet while riding, even on rough roads.  They apparently can be mounted horizontally on a bicycle helmet and are reportedly secure but I have not tried that.  The one other Orfos user that I have met has his rear light mounted that way and has not had any problems.  The manufacturer recommends that they not be mounted horizontally on the bicycle itself because horizontal mounting is not as secure.\nI have not had any of the problems reported by other users with spontaneous battery drain while not in use.\nSo, since I like the lights, why only 3 stars?  There are some issues.\nCharging the lights is a SLOW process.  Using a multi-port USB charger rated at 12 W per port the lights took just over 2:50 to charge, much longer than the claimed 90 minutes.\nThe first set I received had run times nowhere near the claimed burn times and also had other problems; the company replaced them.  The replacement set performs considerably better than the original pair but burn times are still well below the claimed times except on Steady/High where my replacement set actually burns longer than the 1:15 claimed time.  Mine ran over 1:30.  My measured burn time for the lights starting from a full charge was generally about 50-60% of the claimed burn time except on Steady/High.  The manufacturer told me that they have experienced some problems with inconsistent battery performance in lights from recent production runs due to challenges related to use of an uncommon battery chemistry (LiFePO4).  It sounds like early adopters may have gotten better lights than those of us who acquired the lights later.\nOne of the replacements had some excess casing material that made it hard to insert the USB charging cable, but I was able to trim that off.  The switches on the batteries can be rather fussy, frequently making it hard to set the battery mode/intensity correctly. The lights are supposed to switch into Power Saver Mode for about 10-20 minutes when the battery is dying.  My replacement lights do make the switch, but they stay in Power Saver Mode for only about 5 minutes or less before they start generating dim random flashes.  The lights do not give any audible indication that they are failing. These manufacturing and performance issues raise concerns about quality control and longevity.\nMounting the magnets can be a challenge.  The magnets themselves are quite strong and once they are mounted the lights seem secure.  I have used the Orfos lights on 3 different bikes: an older road bike that I have set up for commuting, a newer road bike I ride for fun and a time trial bike.  The front light is supposed to be mounted on the head tube, but I was not able to mount it there on of ANY of the bikes I ride.  On ALL of my bikes the brake and/or derailleur cables would push the light off of its magnetic attachment during sharp turns.  My impression is that if my road bike stems were longer the cables would be far enough forward to avoid problems but my 80-90 mm stems just don't work with these lights.  Initially I attached the front light to my fork and that worked on two of the bikes but I was concerned that it would be easy to accidentally rotate the magnet to the inside, risking damage to both the wheel and the light. Ovalized/aero tapered fork blades make it hard to mount the light really securely.  Fortunately I was able to devise a handlebar mount that works well by using a K-Edge Go Big Camera Bicycle Mount. I found several of those mounts on sale for about $15, otherwise the cost would have been prohibitive.\nMounting the rear light on the seat post works OK if there is enough seat post exposed to secure the magnet.  Under-saddle bags for spares/... may interfere with the light depending on saddle height.  I have not found any way to mount the rear light on the seat post or seat tube on the time trial bike.  I have water bottle cages behind the seat on that bike and I was able to secure the magnet to the bottle cages but the zip ties do interfere somewhat with inserting/removing the water bottles.  Orfos needs to offer better mounting options for the magnets.\nBottom line: Knowing all of this would I buy the lights?  Probably.  They have some flaws and they are ridiculously expensive but they are quite bright and they definitely make me more visible.\nTest method I used: I measured the burn times indoors with the lights mounted on one of the road bikes and because the lights generate a good bit of heat on the Medium and High settings I used a fan to create airflow which should simulate real world use reasonably well.", "summary": "Bright lights with some issues.", "unixReviewTime": 1475884800}

While you're at it, perhaps strap a full size lawn chair to your back so you can sit on that instead of a flat rock or a bear canister.

I would never allow my children to use a regulation indoor volleyball outside, but I would expect these balls to be a little more durable since that's the only place most kids have to practice at that age.

What is really disappointing is: both were fantastic lights at first, but neither made it past 18 months (first one failed after six months). The problems: poor mount, electrical system not built to last, silly instance on using their USB cable for charging.\n\nProblem with first light that appears on all Expilions: cheap mount. They don't seem to have improved this at all; the light rattles around in the mount. My first light actually fell to the ground when the base of the mount failed (snapped). Well these things happen and other reviews noted the failure. The customer service at Cygolite was excellent and they quickly mailed me a new, better version of the Expilion, with a supposedly improved mount. And in all fairness the new mount didn't \"fail\" exactly.\n\nThe new light was better, stronger, faster. But the mount was still lame. I had to super glue it to stop it from swiveling since no amount of screwing it down prevented this. The swivel is an intended benefit so you can angel the light when you turn, but if it swivels on its own that's no good. But the super glue worked and I didn't care, even though it rattled in its mount (again). Thats annoying and can't be good for the light.\n\nThen the killer: electrical failure at 18 months. At first the battery would die quickly so I figured it was time for a new battery. Not unreasonable after a year of almost daily use. But after ordering a new battery from Cygolite and installing it, it turns out that after the four or five hours of charging: still dead in 30 minutes. I get the low battery warning, and the light starts to fade soon after. I commute to work in the dark every day... that simply won't do.\n\nA final annoyance: they say that you have to use THEIR USB cable to charge the light. I obeyed them, but this is a major hassle for a commuter. I would like to be able to use any USB cable, at any time in the home or office to charge it. The \"U\" in USB stands for \"Universal\". The coolness of USB charging goes out the window if you make me use your cable.\n\nAs I said their customer service is great, so if I call them they might replace this light too, but sorry Cygolite. I wanted to love you. I really did for a time. But... I've been hurt before. I don't want to be hurt again... and by that I mean by crashing into something in the dark.

The problem is the reel on the spincast models (in other words, a closed reel).  I bought one just to do indoor practice casting this winter, and as it turns out, the cat loves chasing the practice lure (it has no hooks) and he gets some exercise, so we both enjoy it.  That was only a few weeks ago and unfortunately, I'm now on my third Dock Demon.  The first one lasted a week with very light indoor use (maybe 30 - 40 practice casts) before the thumb button mechanism stuck in the pressed position so it couldn't be reeled in.  It's possible I could have taken it apart, messed with it, and gotten it working again for a while, but since it was so new I just returned it and got a new one.  The second one then lasted TWO weeks before the reel mechanism jammed and would not reel in for some reason, but that time the problem did not involve the thumb button.  I decided to give it one more try and returned the second one and exchanged it for a new one.  The third one is still just a few days old so we'll see how long it lasts.  Either way there's no way the first two should have failed so soon.  Other than the failure rate on the spincast reel, it's not a bad little combo, especially for the price. Btw, you can buy the Dock Demon Spincast shown in the ad above for $9.95 all day long at a certain national big box store chain if you have that option, and the Deluxe Dock Demon (open reel, cork handle, and a 6\" longer rod) for $16.95.

It's a minor inconvenience but I would have preferred one motion.\nThere was no stakes additional guy lines for the sides of the rainfly, although there are loops on the bottom of the rainfly that suggest that is its use. I'll be buying more stakes/cord to fix that going forward, I was able to use plastic bundling from firewood to imitate a cord and keep the rainfly from pressing against the inside of my tent during 2 nights of light rain.\nAs seen in the stock photo, the screen part of the door only zips down from the top 25% or so of the door so you will have to open the door to get better ventilation.

I have no problem falling asleep while my Wife uses the bike.\n[+ EASY SETUP]: It took me about 2 hours to put it together myself. All the directions were straightforward.\n[+ COMFORTABLE SEAT]: The padding is thick and firm. It will last a good long time and extended use is not problem.\n[+ SPACE FOR LAPTOP/TABLET ON TOP OF CONSOLE]: The top of the console has a holder for things like books and magazines. My Wife puts our Netbook on there to watch videos and shows and it stays in place no problem.\n[+ NECESSARY ASSEMBLY TOOLS INCLUDED]: Though Nautilus says all necessary tools are included and nothing else needed...You really do need some kind of cutting tool (like a razor knife) to cut through the tape and plastic. Other than that everything required is indeed included.\n[+ CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS]: The included booklet had lettered/numbered diagrams that made putting everything together pretty straightforward. All the tools and nuts and bolts were also packaged together in a way to make it easy to find and know what's what and where.\n[+ DOESN'T REQUIRE A LOT OF SPACE]: We live in a condo and space is tight. We decided to put the bike in our bedroom, between our bed and the wall. The bike is almost flush against the wall on one side and the other side there's only about 2ft of space to get on/off the bike. No problem.\n\n-------------------------------------\n- The Cons\n-------------------------------------\n\n[- VERY HEAVY]: Usually with equipment like this, heavy weight is indicative of quality (and it is, this bike is very solid) but it can also be a negative as the small height adjustment knob on the bottom of the bike wasn't just broken during shipping but was pretty much shattered.\n[- A BIT TIGHT FOR TALL FOLKS]: My wife is 5'11\" and even with the seat all the way back she said her knees still feel a bit cramped. It's not too bad though as she's still able to use the bike and get the workout she wants out of it.\n\n=====================\nConclusion\n=====================\n\nThis is a good, solid bike and requires little space and performs well. We both work and have a young child so getting out to the gym isn't easy. We're happy about having this product and would recommend it.", "summary": "A quiet, solid rider", "unixReviewTime": 1371600000}

I have not tried using this mat on top of another mat, but for anyone practicing hot yoga this may be an option of placing this thin mat on top of the thicker one.  That would avoid having to use towels and hoepfully once could still have a firm grip during a very sweaty practice.\n\nI have used similar mat from Gaiam that is much thicker and heavier and I must say that personally I prefer a thicker mat for my practice.

It isn't a dillon, but for a third of the price of a dillon, it works pretty well.  Setup isn't too bad (although the instructions are pretty terrible).  Getting it fine tuned and adjusted is pretty easy (especially if you have some loading experience).  A couple of things to watch though.  First, make sure you have a powder scale or something similar to help you set your powder charge as the chart lee provides is NOT accurate on any of the powders we have used. Second, be prepared to adjust it on a semi regular basis. Third, always make sure you hear it click into its station before you seat the primer (refer back to step two if it doesn't click in), failure to do so could cause the primer to be crushed rather than seated causing it to detonate (which if you are using CCI, Remington, or Winchester primers this will simply wake you up and get your attention but if you are using federal or wolf primers, it can ruin your whole day and then some as these two brands can cascade fire off each other).  Fourth stick with CCI, Remington, or Winchester primers due to #3.\n\nIn the end, I like the loader.  It isn't a dillon but that's like saying a ford isn't a Cadillac.  They both get you there, but one is more luxurious than the other.  One is also far more expensive than the other.

Sure, it gets tedious after a while; ten minutes of cranking takes some patience.  But it's a reasonable tradeoff for an hour of light and/or radio without batteries or access to electricity, and if all you need is five minutes of light, it's a snap.  The light produced is quite bright, has a high and low setting, and can illuminate a small room to allow cooking or reading.

This backpack is the closest I've come to finding a match. I will note that my fiance, who is 6' 3\" was able to adjust this bag to fit him as well, so I expect this will work for a wide variety of users.\n\nThe zippers feel sturdy, the buckles/compression straps are easy to adjust. I also like the compression straps on the bottom of the bag, which could be used to hold a sleeping pad or something similar in a pinch. The organizational pocket in the middle compartment is quite functional. Surprisingly, even though this bag is geared towards males, I actually thought the straps were a bit skinnier than the Sonju bag I received, a plus in my book as it makes this bag more usable for females. I love that the interior fabric is in a contrasting color on the darker colored bags. The pocket on the waist belt is nicely sized and can fit a phone or a small snack - I also appreciate that the waist belt can be hidden away so desired. I found that despite stuffing the pockets full, this bag doesn't suffer from something other packs do - where if you stuff one pocket full, it encroaches upon the space in the neighboring pocket... this backpack seems to have been designed well enough that that's not a problem! The zippered pockets behind the water bottle pockets are super useful and one of my favorite parts of this bag.\n\nAs for cons...the \"barrier\" pocket for sunglasses is quite difficult to open one-handed. The top handle is flimsy, but on this bag there's another handle anyway so not a big deal. I wish that the vented spongey material on the straps extended farther down, because the bottom of these straps are stiff, probably to make them more sturdy, but it is a bit uncomfortable. I don't find this bag particularly water-resistant; I had my phone in the top \"barrier\" pocket and there were several raindrops on the phone screen when I took it out to check the time 5 minutes after it had started raining. I wish the front pocket had an organizational unit as well and that both sides of the waist belt had a zipper pouch. I've had this bag for a little over half a year, and the mesh on the waterbottle pocket started to fray a bit...patched up with some clear nail polish, but I much preferred the sturdier water bottle pockets on the 'Superior' pack. I don't particularly like the color choices - I'd love an all gray or the gray/green combo that's offered on the female version of this bag.\n\nOverall, this is a good quality bag if you're looking for something larger than the average backpack, fairly comfortable, and moderately priced.", "summary": "Not perfect, but pretty close!

I Carry a Tiny Spray Bottle of Disinfectant with me & Give a Quick Spray to the Machines, Before I Climb On.  Yes, Im One Of Those People That Grab a Couple of Wipes, When I Go Into the Grocery Store or Wal-Mart & Give the Basket a Good Quick Wipe.  I Hate the Idea of Germs Everywhere & I Dont Like Climbing on a Sweaty Machine.  When I Get Off the Machines, I Always Wipe it Off For the Next Person.  Everyone Should Do That, but That Doesnt Happen.  So, One of These Towels will Be Marked & Reserved as my Gym, Sweat Towel to Use on the Machines.  The Other Towel Im Using for MY Sweat Towel and that One Wont be Marked  That Way I Dont Get Them Mixed Up.  I Also Bring My Own Locker Room Towel In With Me.  By Taking My Own Towels, I Save about $10 or So a Week & Over Time It Adds Up.  Then, Being Cheap (Ahem Frugal) I Bring Plenty of My Own Water, (Sometimes with Lemon or Lime in It) so I can Avoid the Temptation of the Overpriced Juice Bar.  Its Like the Ice Cream Truck.  When Youre Hot, you Put Out The Money, Then Later You Think, How Much Did I Pay For That Thing?  I Could Have Bought a Whole Box of Them For That, at the Store.  It Pays to Plan Ahead & These Little Towels Can Be Both A Convenience and a Money Saver in the Long Run.\n\nMicrofiber Towels Wash Up Really Easy, but I Usually Wash My Microfiber Towels Separate From the Rest of the Wash.  I Use Microfiber Towels for Cleaning & Polishing My Vehicles Too.  Of Course You Have to Keep Them Separate.  You Cant Use the Towels on Your Face That Youre Using on Your Truck or for Disinfectant.  I Make sure my Vehicle Microfiber Towels are all Red & Yellow, so I Dont Get Them Mixed Up With the Others.  If you Use Some for Dusting & Different Uses, I Suggest Going with Different Colors.  There are Also Different Grades of Micro Fiber Towels.  Some Have More Fiber To Them & Some are Finer.  It Depends on What Youre Wanting to Use it For.  This Grade of Microfiber Towel is Just Right for a Certain Amount of Absorbency & a Little Bit of Exfoliation.  Its Really Good For the arms & Legs or Wiping the Sweat From Your Face.\n\nI Received These Free or Reduced for my Honest Review.  Thank You For Reading.  Im Always Available to Answer Questions.

But the lenses clean easily  just use non-scratch material.\n\nI also appreciate the handy yet tough carrying case along with a bag for protecting the goggles and even cleaning them.

We saw at least a couple of these around the campground (Ohanapekosh).\n\nGood things:\n- Set up really was very quick.  Putting in the pegs is the most time consuming part.\n- Once it was up it looked great and was roomy enough inside to easily fit four 39x84 rectangular sleeping bags.\n- There are two mesh vents above two of the windows so you can get some ventilation with the windows closed.  That said, it would be nice to be able to close those if desired.\n- Breaking the tent down was not particularly hard and after you do it once you understand how it works and future times should be faster.  The important part is that the frame arms need to be bent (the hinge is under the cloth joint cover so you may need to lift the cover to see what direction it bends) after telescoping them closed.  then you just try to keep it compact (we didn't bother with the ties that were included as they were thin and not helpful but if you brought some wider straps that would be useful) and stuff it in the case which was not that hard to do (can be done by one person but better with two).\n- Easy to carry around/store when in the case.\n\nA few things I didn't like:\n-  It's too easy for the telescoping frame arms to collapse by pressing in the metal \"bump\" that pops out when extended.  Our toddler kept pushing it in (it's that easy to do) and collapsing part of the tent which then led the other arms to collapse too.\n- Door is kind of unnecessarily large which requires a lot of zipping to open/close.  Horizontal zipping is more of a hassle too.\n- Only two mesh pockets inside and a ring at the ceiling to hang a light from.  Would have liked a little more storage inside.\n- The integrated rain fly does not cover the side windows as well but it probably won't leak as there is protective stitching/flap to keep rain out when the window is closed.\n\nBottom line is that we really enjoyed using this tent despite some concerns about the telescoping arms being easily collapsed due to the lack of a locking mechanism (a simple hole that you could put a pin through would suffice) for the four frame arms and recommend it highly.", "summary": "Works well enough and very convenient tent.", "unixReviewTime": 1500595200}

One feature you don't always see is that it has dual time readouts, which is useful for those who need to keep track of a second time zone. Setting the various functions will require reading the instructions the first time, but nothing is too difficult.\n\nThe watch is darker than the product page pictures, and is really quite sharp looking - I like the red accents. It is comfortable to wear, with a wider band than some.\n\nThere are two things that keep this from getting the highest rating. First, the display is angle dependent; from certain angles it just disappears. It is quite readable from the other angles. This means that you have to turn your wrist properly to see it clearly. The other thing I don't care for is the back lighting. It is \"luminescence\" instead of a more traditional lighting. The idea is that the entire back is lit, but is shows through only the letters - this results in less energy use. The light lasts about 3 seconds after you push the button. What it means in practice is that the back lighting is pretty dim. In daytime, if the watch is the shadows, the back light doesn't really do much at all. I would prefer a light that is at least three times brighter. It does show up in total darkness.\n\nSummary: Nice looking with great features, but the backlight could use some work.

The vise is made of mostly sturdy metal, with some plastic mixed in mainly in the form of adjustment  knobs and the fire's feet.\nFollowing the simple to comprehend instructions, complete with photos, I had this assembled in about 5 minutes. It just so happened that I had a brand new bolt action that I purchased the day before that needed a scope mounted onto it. I put the butt stock into the rear of the vise and clamped it down with the padded knobs. The fore stock went into the front V-shaped fork and using the adjustment knobs, I leveled the rifle. A center support is also there to support the middle of the rifle. There is an included magnetic bubble level that comes with the vise. After that, it was extremely easy to level the scope reticle properly.\nThis vise can also be used for cleaning and mechanical sighting in of an optic. The instructions state very clearly that a clamped and strapped down weapon should NOT be fired from this vise. The instructions do say that one can collapse the rear clamp and center support (they are on tubes and slide back and forth, depending on the length of your firearm) all the way forward to the front V rest and fire the gun. Then, while keeping the vise in place, one can clamp their gun in and adjust their optic's point of aim to the fund's point of impact after a 3 to 5 shot group is shot. That is the mechanical sighting in they are referring to in the product description.

I'm completely satisfied with this product. It's easy to assemble and works perfectly. I recommend watching several different videos on YouTube under the heading \"ab wheel.\" And watch them several times. The movement that works best is easy to do correctly, but clearly understanding what constitutes correct movement requires thinking and experimentation. Done correctly, the movement works the abs more intensely than anything else I have done; unlike other ab exercises, this one is fun. Be careful not to overdo it. Initially, it is difficult to tell how hard you're working your abs, and you may experience soreness in your abs that is more intense than you have previously experienced. If so, don't panic. Just wait patiently until the pain has gone away, even if it takes 10 days or so. Then, use the wheel again, trying not to overdo it. Within a couple of weeks, I could see my abs visibly changing in shape for the better. I may not lose enough weight to have defined abs, but the additional strength in my abs is noticeable during normal activity during the day - just a good, different feeling.\n\nUpdate in December 2014:\n\nI'm still enthused and thankful I tried this way to strengthen my abs. My abs are now stronger by far than ever before. I find the exercise fun to do. My abs are now strong enough that my triceps seem to be straining while my abs are having no trouble doing 20 reps.

They are seller reviews. Please, know the difference. They received knock off knives because they failed to pay attention to who they were buying it from.

If you fail to do this, do not review the product you get on the amazon review pages, go to their seller profile and write a review.\n\nFor those of you who pay attention and want an actual product review:\nThe best knife I have ever owned. I have owned tons of gerbers and other knives through the years, mostly given to me by the military. I had a couple auto knives and I just never felt that I could deploy them in time for a stressful and threatening situation. I mostly prefer smaller knives, because I also carry a sidearm daily and the knife is just a secondary line of defense. I was skeptical after buying many cheaper non auto knives if this thing would open easily, and it does. This knife is the thing of a EDC'ers wet dream. I compared it to the para 3 and while I do usually prefer smaller knives, the odd size of the para 3 was actually bigger. The handle on the para 2 is perfect. The grip you get is amazing. I wish my handguns had grip like this thing. I wish all things had grip like this thing. I am so impressed, I will never carry another brand again. All these years I have been missing out. The pictures just do not do this thing justice. You need to hold it. Wrap your fingers around this work of perfection and it won't make it back into the case ever again. I would include pics, but there is no point. The only downside I don't like about this knife is the clip. It sits pretty high in the pocket and that is something I try to hide. Out of sight out of mind. So I bought an aftermarket clip to sit lower in my pocket. I can still deploy it the same way.\n\nThe best part about this knife, is that it says made in Colorado, Earth. Spyderco put that it is made on Earth... It's the small things that keep me amused in life...\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this knife.", "summary": "I waited way too long to buy this.", "unixReviewTime": 1523577600}

You can also choose between a few different frame colors when you order.  This means I can switch the look of the glasses whenever I want.  Lenses are quality and the frames are pretty light and durable which is what I was looking for because I tend to be very hard on my glasses.  Id buy these again and probably will once I lose or break this set. Not much negative at this point on these glasses.

It is pretty much bare and doesn't have a lot to offer. However, I am glad to be able to export my information to Runkeeper automatically. This makes the watch perfect for me.\n\nRunning (GPS) - It's great. It picks up a signal fast, gives good and customizable feedback, and isn't bulky. I would, however, like to be able to virtually race against my previous runs. I believe I can only do this with pre-set times and distances thus far.\n\nRunning (Accelerometer) - I haven't gotten to try this out yet. I am glad to know that the distance can be calibrated to compensate for error.\n\nCycling (GPS) - This was great and probably my favorite aspect of the watch. I've had the unit mount setup on my Trek for about 2 weeks but have been running and not cycling. Yesterday I placed my unit into the mount and rode a short route. The GPS was quick and the feedback displayed was better than my current mounted computer.\n\nCycling (Cadence Sensor) - This I have yet to try as well. I did not buy the TomTom cadence sensor. I went with the Wahoo bluetooth and will update once I can get a few outside and trainer sessions in with it.\n\nSwimming (Accelerometer) - This, as some other users discussed it, was ok. I love being able to swim with the device and it not bother me; however it does tend to miss a lap here and there. I swam in a meter pool, which greatly helped the setup considering the restricted units. I'm impressed, but I really want it to count my laps more accurately without having to put 'race effort' into my turns as to exaggerate them.\n\nHeart Rate Sensor - This is a great sensor with no fit issues. I've performed several 10+ miles runs without chaffing or irritation. The sensor seems to be picking up correct readings. No complaints here as the unit always contacts the sensor easily.\n\nGreat product, but please work on that software/website!
